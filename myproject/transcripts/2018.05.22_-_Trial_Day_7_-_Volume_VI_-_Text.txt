            5     Please be seated.  Put your witness back on the stand.

            6               Ms. Zimmerman, you can be seated.

            7               And, sir, you're still under oath from yesterday.

            8               You may proceed.

            9                     DIRECT EXAMINATION (Resumed)

           10     BY MR. FARRAR:

           11     Q.  Dr. David, I don't want to rehash anything, but just,

           12     sort of, so we know where we left off, you discussed the

           13     function operation, environment of use and the risk that you

           14     looked at associated with the Bair Hugger yesterday,

           15     correct?

           16     A.  Correct.

           17     Q.  And right where we were going to was the sort of fancy

           18     term mechanism of jury.  In other words, how are the

           19     particles getting from the ground into the surgical site?

           20     And from your view and your knowledge and experience and

           21     training, do you have an opinion as to how particles are

           22     getting into the surgical site?

           23     A.  I do.

           24     Q.  What's that opinion?

           25     A.  That the Bair Hugger expelled forced warm air around the




                                                               1044



            1     patient on the surgical table.  This air coming out on the

            2     side through the blanket caused turbulences that interfered

            3     with the flow of air from the ceiling to the ground, to the

            4     floor.  These turbulences can lift up particles from

            5     nonsterile field and deposit it on the surgical field.

            6     Q.  During the course of the case we've talked lot about

            7     unidirectional flow, and I understand that's sort of a term

            8     of art in the medical field.  And I don't want to bore

            9     anybody, but can you sort of tell me what the purpose and --

           10     what is unidirectional flow and what the purpose is?

           11     A.  Sure.  I spent much time of my career in operating rooms

           12     that do have unidirectional flow for specific purpose of

           13     keeping the surgical wound area clean.  The concept can be

           14     attributed by different names, but the totality is to see

           15     that clean air coming from the ceiling directed to the floor

           16     of the operating room and dissipated outside through vents.

           17     Actually, Distinguished Professor Elghobashi showed the

           18     video yesterday at the end that has a curtain of air that

           19     blew color that come down.

           20     Q.  And he said something about it extinguishing or

           21     exhausting the particles or something like that?

           22     A.  Correct.

           23     Q.  I can't remember the exact word he used.  Speaking of --

           24     I know you were here for Dr. Elgobashi's testimony, and he

           25     testified there's no such thing as true unidirectional flow




                                                               1045



            1     in an operating room.  Do you recall that?

            2     A.  I do.

            3     Q.  Now, what was your understanding of what he was saying

            4     there?

            5               MS. PRUITT:  Objection, Your Honor.

            6               THE COURT:  Sustained.

            7     BY MR. FARRAR:

            8     Q.  Do you have an opinion as a biomedical engineer as to

            9     what he was saying on that?

           10               MS. PRUITT:  Same objection.

           11               THE COURT:  Sustained.  Rule 26, if nothing else.

           12     BY MR. FARRAR:

           13     Q.  Is unidirectional flow true unidirectional flow in the

           14     scientific meaning of that word?

           15     A.  No, it does not.

           16     Q.  Explain.

           17     A.  The phenomena that was clearly demonstrated yesterday in

           18     this courtroom is showing that when air is moving from one

           19     size grill in the ceiling to a wider size, the room size,

           20     this transition may cause some Eddy currents, turbulences.

           21     So unidirectional flow is in medical literature, medical

           22     field like in the operating rooms I worked in, we call it

           23     like that, is the idea that the air, the clean air has one

           24     direction, unidirectional flow, from the ceiling to the

           25     floor.




                                                               1046



            1     Q.  You -- your opinion as to how the particles get from the

            2     ground, from the floor of the nonsterile to the surgical

            3     wound, what did you rely on to form the basis of that

            4     opinion?

            5     A.  First of all, my experience.  I participate in operating

            6     room design in the Texas Medical Center.  I was the director

            7     of biomedical engineering department that has responsibility

            8     for over 50 operating rooms and a dozen catheterization

            9     laboratory that has similar air circulation mechanism and

           10     understanding of medical devices operation, including all

           11     the concept of heating, fan, moving air, in electrocautery,

           12     computer, Bair Hugger, in all of these medical devices are

           13     all part of my daily work at the Texas Medical Center.  In

           14     addition, I review expert opinion and medical literature.

           15     Q.  Okay.  So I want to start with the first of that.

           16     That's basically your 35 years of working in the field?

           17     A.  I hesitate to say it, but it's more.  It's more like

           18     40 years now.

           19     Q.  My math may be bad.  But it's your training and your

           20     education tells you that if you're blowing hot air towards

           21     the ground it's going to disrupt the unidirectional flow?

           22               MS. PRUITT:  Objection, Your Honor.  Leading.

           23               MR. FARRAR:  Let me rephrase.

           24     BY MR. FARRAR:

           25     Q.  Tell me how your experience and training would lead you




                                                               1047



            1     to the opinion that the Bair Hugger could force particles

            2     into the surgical field?

            3     A.  First of all, it's a basic engineering principle that

            4     the operating rooms are kept cold for several reasons,

            5     prevention of infection is one of them, but also all the

            6     surgeons, everybody is wearing scrubs and a lot of

            7     protective garment, but the temperature of the operating

            8     room is colder than normal room, I would say.

            9     Q.  Colder than in here?

           10     A.  Oh, yeah, for sure.  You feel it when you walk into

           11     operating room that you are in a different environment.

           12     Then when you have something that generate forced air and

           13     move it out, it's engineering principle.  You don't have to

           14     be a biomechanical expert to understand that hot air would

           15     move upwards in exchange of molecules of cold air that would

           16     be pushed down.  So if you have a hot air source in a cold

           17     room, it is engineering principle that you know where the

           18     flow will take place.

           19     Q.  You mentioned there was some literature that supported

           20     your opinion, and there's some articles that you brought

           21     that are up there in Manila folders.  And do you remember

           22     the names of the articles that you looked at to help support

           23     your opinions or that did support your opinions?

           24     A.  They have long titles, so I don't think I can remember.

           25     Q.  We always talk about them by author's name.  It's




                                                               1048



            1     easier.

            2     A.  But McGovern from UK and group of scientists from here,

            3     from Minneapolis, Minnesota, collaborated on a couple

            4     studies, also Legg and Hamer, orthopedic surgeon,

            5     anesthesiologist, and other scientist from UK and Belani, I

            6     believe, and -- who else?

            7     Q.  Let's take a look at --

            8               MS. PRUITT:  Your Honor, I'm going to have to

            9     object because the studies the doctor just cited are in

           10     violation of the Court's ruling on MIL1.  They are not

           11     Tablegard.

           12               THE COURT:  That could be.  We'll wait and see.

           13     BY MR. FARRAR:

           14     Q.  Let's talk about McGovern first, which is Exhibit 93.  I

           15     think you have it up there, doctor.

           16     A.  I do.

           17     Q.  And I know the jury has heard about it, so I just want

           18     to sort of go to the discussion section, which is a couple

           19     pages in.  And do you see where the discussion starts?

           20     A.  Yes.

           21     Q.  And I'm going to read this and just tell me if I read it

           22     correct, but it says --

           23               MS. PRUITT:  Your Honor, same objection.  MIL1.

           24               THE COURT:  Approach the bench.

           25                       (Side-bar discussion.)




                                                               1049



            1               THE COURT:  While you're here, Kathy is still back

            2     there copying these massive submissions that was sent in

            3     either late last night --

            4               MR. FARRAR:  We can bring CV.  I think it's coming

            5     actually, but I'll talk to Genevieve.

            6               THE COURT:  Okay.  It's driving her nuts, and it

            7     broke the copier and -- so please don't do that.  Okay.  So

            8     what's the issue here?

            9               MR. FARRAR:  They had to be individually.  That's

           10     what's sort of painful.

           11               MS. PRUITT:  The issue here, judge, is --

           12               THE COURT:  At least that's some explanation.  I

           13     took a look.  I didn't have time obviously to read what was

           14     coming off.  It doesn't look like it's particularly time

           15     sensitive.

           16               MR. FARRAR:  We wanted to just get it in before we

           17     rested, which we're doing today.  It's not time sensitive.

           18               THE COURT:  That's some explanation for why she's

           19     tearing her hair out.

           20               MR. FARRAR:  Honestly, it's an offer of proof,

           21     Your Honor.  You don't need to really look at it.

           22               THE COURT:  Well, how is she supposed to know

           23     that?

           24               MR. FARRAR:  No.  Totally.  Totally.  I am telling

           25     you now.




                                                               1050



            1               THE COURT:  Right.  I saw that myself, which made

            2     it even worse because I thought -- so, anyway, that's beside

            3     the point, but -- so that's what's going on back there.

            4               MS. PRUITT:  I knew something was --

            5               MR. FARRAR:  I am not going to say a word about

            6     resistant particles.  I am reading the parts about the

            7     impact of forced air warming on the airflow.  I'm not -- I'm

            8     skipping -- that's why I'm reading it, because I'm skipping

            9     the part about compared to conductive warming.

           10               MS. PRUITT:  But, Your Honor, itself is a

           11     comparison of the HotDog and the Bair Hugger.

           12               THE COURT:  But didn't we already cover this in --

           13     you wanted the whole thing out, and I denied the motion to

           14     keep the whole thing out.

           15               MS. PRUITT:  I understood on the basis of post

           16     distribution, but not on the basis of MIL1, because if he's

           17     going to rely on these studies that are a comparison between

           18     the HotDog and not the Tablegard, then the court has ruled

           19     under MIL1 that they can't do that.

           20               THE COURT:  Right.  But you correctly observed, if

           21     I remember in your memo from yesterday, that as to causation

           22     it could be used and they can't talk about the HotDog

           23     particularly, but the McGovern study as a whole hasn't been

           24     ruled completely inadmissible.  And so if you proceed in

           25     this careful way and by reading, I'll allow some leading




                                                               1051



            1     because you are threading a narrow hole in the needle here.

            2     You may proceed like that.

            3               MR. FARRAR:  I'm doing a tap dance.

            4               THE COURT:  But it's hard to imagine what in

            5     McGovern is going to be relevant.

            6               MR. FARRAR:  I've got one sentence.

            7               THE COURT:  One sentence?  What is it?

            8               MR. FARRAR:  Well, it's this one.  You can see

            9     where my highlighting stops to make sure that I say the

           10     right thing.  That's exactly what he just testified to.

           11               THE COURT:  You talked about on the Friday before

           12     the trial started that if the plaintiffs decided to rely on

           13     McGovern that they would be opening the door to some of this

           14     Augustine business?

           15               MS. PRUITT:  Yes, ma'am.  Yes, ma'am.

           16               THE COURT:  So to me that's a statement of not a

           17     hundred percent inadmissibility, but --

           18               MS. PRUITT:  The one other thing I want to bring

           19     out and make sure I have on the record, Your Honor, is

           20     they're trying now to use Dr. David as a causation witness

           21     and he -- that's a brand new opinion under Rule 26.

           22               THE COURT:  Right.

           23               MS. PRUITT:  They're just glomming on.  And you

           24     can't just show up in court and -- and that's what that

           25     phrase goes to.




                                                               1052



            1               THE COURT:  Let's get him off the stand.  I know.

            2     I know.  It is problematic, but I'm letting him do this

            3     little bit.  I recognize that it is problematic.  So you

            4     just have to do the best you can.

            5               MS. PRUITT:  And, Your Honor, the studies he

            6     talked about, Reed, Albrecht, Albrecht and Leaper, we've got

            7     the same issue.  They're all HotDog comparisons.  They're

            8     not the Tablegard.  He's not a causation expert.  So I'm

            9     going to have to object to all of them.  I don't want to

           10     impede the --

           11               MR. FARRAR:  I'm happy to give a running objection

           12     on the record that that objection is there.

           13               THE COURT:  So I was surprised when you started

           14     off right away this morning do you have an opinion on how

           15     the bacteria is getting into the --

           16               MR. FARRAR:  For purpose of this design he has to

           17     be able to --

           18               THE COURT:  Yeah, but that's not in his opinion.

           19               MR. FARRAR:  It is.

           20               THE COURT:  It isn't.

           21               MR. FARRAR:  A hundred percent, Your Honor.  I

           22     don't have the page memorized, but I can show it to you.

           23     I'll go get my copy, if it's easier.

           24               THE COURT:  It might be.

           25               MR. FARRAR:  Okay.  I happen to have it squared




                                                               1053



            1     because I'm trying to avoid this, and it's directly there.

            2     And for the record, it's page 8 of his report.

            3               THE COURT:  I think he testified that it does,

            4     rather than it can, but that's a small enough difference

            5     that we'll let it stand.

            6               Okay.  Well, let's see what you do.

            7               MR. FARRAR:  I'm going to be narrow.

            8                           (IN OPEN COURT)

            9     BY MR. FARRAR:

           10     Q.  Dr. David, we were talking when we left off about the

           11     McGovern study and we're on the discussion.  Do you recall

           12     where we were?

           13     A.  Yes.

           14     Q.  First paragraph?  And I'm going to read this and just

           15     let me know if I -- confirm if I read it correctly, but it

           16     says, Forced air warming was found to have a significant and

           17     disruptive impact on the clean airflow patterns over the

           18     surgical site.  Did I read that correctly?

           19     A.  You did.

           20     Q.  And is that sort of the same opinion that you've been --

           21     that you gave based on your biomedical engineering

           22     background?

           23     A.  Correct.

           24     Q.  And these studies have been talked about through

           25     Dr. Jarvis, so I just want to sort of go through them




                                                               1054



            1     quickly.  But you also said Legg and Hamer, which I believe

            2     is Exhibit 96.  Is this the Legg and Hamer -- one of the

            3     Legg and Hamer articles you were referring to?

            4     A.  I did.

            5     Q.  And if you go to results also.  And do you see the

            6     section under results right below it that says airflow

            7     visualization?

            8     A.  I do.

            9     Q.  And we'll read this one also.  It says, Unidirectional

           10     airflow -- that's what we've been talking about, correct?

           11     A.  Correct.

           12     Q.  -- was significantly disrupted when forced air warming

           13     was used.  Convection currents were set up within seconds of

           14     the forced air warming system starting up.  The bubbles rose

           15     approximately one meter above the operating site, moved away

           16     from the drape and then fell directly onto the surgical site

           17     before rising again to start the same cycle.  Did I read

           18     that correctly?

           19               MS. PRUITT:  Same objection, Your Honor.

           20               THE COURT:  I'll allow it.

           21     BY MR. FARRAR:

           22     Q.  Why is that significant to you, doctor?

           23     A.  Because this scientific study demonstrates exactly the

           24     phenomena that I have been concerned about and that is the

           25     expel of hot air, forced warm air from the blanket of the




                                                               1055



            1     Bair Hugger, disrupt the normal current from ceiling to

            2     floor and cause disturbance in vortex moved the particle

            3     back up from nonsterile to the sterile field.

            4     Q.  And if you would look, at article -- Plaintiffs'

            5     Exhibit 94, which is the other Legg and Hamer article that

            6     you referred to.  And again under discussion, which is I

            7     guess on the third page, a couple of paragraphs down, do you

            8     see the paragraph that begins with We have?

            9     A.  I do.

           10     Q.  And the article states, "we have show that in our

           11     experimental theatre setup, forced air warming significantly

           12     increases the temperature and number of particles over the

           13     surgical site."  Did I read that correctly?

           14     A.  Yes.

           15               MS. PRUITT:  Objection, Your Honor.  Same

           16     objection.

           17               THE COURT:  I'll allow it.

           18               THE WITNESS:  You did.

           19     BY MR. FARRAR:

           20     Q.  Does that further support your opinions based on your

           21     biomedical engineering background as to, what I use the

           22     term, mechanism of injury, how the particles get to the

           23     surgical site?

           24     A.  Certainly does.

           25     Q.  Is that consistent with what you saw and heard




                                                               1056



            1     Dr. Elgobashi testify to?

            2     A.  Exactly the same.

            3     Q.  When you're doing a hazard -- a device hazard analysis

            4     like you do and you find a risk, what do you do as a

            5     biomedical engineer to try to mitigate against that risk?

            6     A.  Try to find alternative mechanism, alternative design,

            7     safer, less risky.

            8     Q.  And I've heard the term safer alternative design.  Is

            9     that a term you use?

           10     A.  That would be fine.

           11     Q.  Can you define that for me?

           12     A.  Safer alternative design is a concept by which you

           13     provide the same benefits, however with reduced or no risk

           14     associated with the application.

           15     Q.  Okay.  So you want -- well, I guess let me ask you for

           16     the Bair Hugger, what was your goal in trying to find a

           17     safer alternative design?

           18     A.  Very simply to eliminate the expel of warm air around

           19     the surgical site from the blanket and capture and

           20     recirculate it back.

           21     Q.  Did you look at -- well, let me ask you this.  You

           22     talked about the Bair Hugger is convective heating; is that

           23     correct?

           24     A.  Correct.

           25     Q.  Is there other ways to warm patients?




                                                               1057



            1     A.  There are mainly three physical principles.

            2     Q.  Hang on one second.  There is an objection.

            3               MS. PRUITT:  Objection, Your Honor.  MIL1.

            4               THE COURT:  Yeah, overruled.

            5     BY MR. FARRAR:

            6     Q.  Continue.

            7     A.  There are basically three engineering principle to move

            8     a mass of temperature from one place to another.  One is

            9     called convection.  You can think about it as an oven where

           10     you are heating or cooling the air around us or on the food

           11     and that temperature is changing according to the

           12     environment.

           13               Another way is conduction.  Conduction is the

           14     requirement to have physical touch in order to move the

           15     temperatures from point to point.  The example would be a

           16     stovetop.  When you put a pot on the stove, you need to

           17     touch the heating element and the heat transfer to whatever

           18     you are cooking.

           19               And the third one is radiation.  If you walk out

           20     to a sunny day here in Minneapolis, you will feel the sun,

           21     the sun radiate electromagnetic waves that when they heat

           22     the body you feel temperature change.

           23     Q.  Did you find in your research an example of a conductive

           24     product that in your opinion would be safer than the Bair

           25     Hugger to warm patients intraoperatively?




                                                               1058



            1     A.  I did.

            2     Q.  What was?

            3     A.  This was the Tablegard.

            4     Q.  The Tablegard.  And we have sort of a blowup.  It's not

            5     the best.  I'll tell you what.

            6               Your Honor, can I just set it here, if defendants

            7     don't have an objection to it, just so the jury can see?

            8               THE COURT:  Just put it on the screen and

            9     everybody can see it.

           10               MR. FARRAR:  Good point.

           11               1611.

           12     BY MR. FARRAR:

           13     Q.  And we will talk a little bit more about it, but I guess

           14     the first question is, To determine if something is a safer

           15     alternative, it has to be as effective in doing what it's

           16     supposed to do; is that right?

           17     A.  That's right.

           18     Q.  Did you do any investigation as to whether conductive

           19     and convective heating, if one is better than the other?

           20     A.  I did.

           21     Q.  What was your determination?

           22     A.  Just like the clinical consultant for 3M, Dr. Dan

           23     Sessler, testified in his testimony that he found those two

           24     principle to be of same benefits.

           25     Q.  If you would, Doctor, turn to, in this book that you




                                                               1059



            1     have up there like this, if you turn to P228.  Is this --

            2               MS. PRUITT:  Your Honor, I'm going to object to

            3     P228.  It's hearsay.

            4               MR. FARRAR:  It's a --

            5               THE COURT:  Hold on.

            6               MR. FARRAR:  Did I not give you a copy, Your

            7     Honor?  I may have yesterday.

            8               THE COURT:  I'll take another one.

            9               MR. FARRAR:  Sure.

           10               THE COURT:  Or just come on up -- come around and

           11     I'll take a look at it.

           12               Oh, yeah.  The objection is sustained.

           13     BY MR. FARRAR:

           14     Q.  After you conducted your research in looking at the

           15     testimony of Dr. Sessler, did you have an opinion as to

           16     whether conductive and convective are equally effective ways

           17     to warm patients during surgery?

           18               MS. PRUITT:  Same objection, Your Honor.

           19               THE COURT:  Sustained.

           20     BY MR. FARRAR:

           21     Q.  Do you have an opinion as to whether convective and

           22     conductive forms of heating intraoperatively are equally

           23     effective?

           24     A.  After I reviewed the documents and literature, I do.

           25     Q.  And your opinion is that they are the same?




                                                               1060



            1     A.  They are the same.

            2     Q.  Okay.  Was conductive technology available in 2009?

            3               MS. PRUITT:  Objection, Your Honor.  MIL-1.

            4               THE COURT:  Overruled.

            5               THE WITNESS:  Of course.  This is a principle

            6     known for long, long time used in at home in electric

            7     blankets and variety of similar situations, so if you touch

            8     something, the temperature is moving from the element that

            9     is hot to the body.

           10     BY MR. FARRAR:

           11     Q.  Was the Tablegard specifically available -- was it on

           12     the market in 2009?

           13     A.  Before that, yes.

           14     Q.  Okay.  What about the Tablegard -- can you put that back

           15     up for me, please?

           16               I guess the easier way to ask this question is can

           17     you tell me how the Tablegard works?

           18     A.  And --

           19     Q.  And you can draw on this, by the way.  I don't know if

           20     that's helpful to you, but if you want to, it's touch

           21     screen.

           22     A.  It will end up like Picasso.  We have a device here that

           23     is essentially contained same component as the Bair Hugger

           24     and we have a surface here that is being heated in the

           25     similar way that the Bair Hugger used its accessory.  In




                                                               1061



            1     between them, we have a hose that convey the hot air from

            2     the device to the bed and return.  So the elements, the

            3     component that are here are basically similar to what the

            4     Bair Hugger is constructing of, having a power supply of fan

            5     that draw the air, having a heating element where the

            6     airflow over get heated, hose connecting to a blanket, the

            7     blanket is put underneath the patient as opposed to the Bair

            8     Hugger that is over the patient, and the additional benefit

            9     here is that there is a hose that circulate the hot air back

           10     to the instrument away from the surgical field.

           11     Q.  Does the Tablegard exhaust the warm air that's being

           12     used to warm the patient, does it exhaust it into the

           13     operating room?

           14     A.  It's circulating.

           15     Q.  It's self contained?

           16     A.  Self contained, good word, yes.

           17               THE COURT REPORTER:  I'm sorry, what?

           18               THE WITNESS:  Self-contained, good word.

           19     BY MR. FARRAR:

           20     Q.  So if I understand the air being used, that's the heated

           21     air is not blown out into the operating room.  Is that fair?

           22               MS. PRUITT:  Objection, Your Honor.  Leading.

           23     BY MR. FARRAR:

           24     Q.  Is the hot air that's being used to warm the patient

           25     blown into the operating room with the Tablegard?




                                                               1062



            1     A.  It is recirculated again and again.

            2     Q.  If you would, Dr. Yadin -- I'm sorry, Dr. David, take a

            3     look at Exhibit 1304.  Could you describe what that document

            4     is to the jury, please?

            5     A.  Exhibit P-1304 is titled Tablegard patient care system

            6     and looks to me like this is a brochure describing the

            7     feature of the system.

            8     Q.  Is this something you relied upon to form your opinions

            9     in the case about the Tablegard?

           10     A.  Yes, I reviewed it and relied upon it.

           11               MR. FARRAR:  Your Honor, we would ask 1304 be

           12     moved into evidence.

           13               MS. PRUITT:  Your Honor, this is a marketing

           14     brochure.  It's hearsay.

           15               THE COURT:  I'm going to allow it with the

           16     following instruction:

           17               Members of the jury, you'll recall that I told you

           18     that evidence is what I admit and that there might be things

           19     that I would admit for one purpose and not another, and I am

           20     allowing this for the purpose of showing that there was a

           21     marketing brochure, but what you can't do is read through it

           22     and take the assertions in this marketing brochure,

           23     Exhibit 1304, as if they were testimony in court, but, you

           24     know, for what it's worth, that there is a marketing

           25     brochure, it's admissible for that purpose.




                                                               1063



            1               MR. FARRAR:  Can I publish it, Your Honor?

            2               THE COURT:  Go ahead.  Then they'll know what I'm

            3     talking about.

            4     BY MR. FARRAR:

            5     Q.  1304, please.  And one of the things I noticed in this,

            6     Dr. David, is under the patient warming system, the third

            7     sort of item right there, and if you would, could you read

            8     that for me?

            9     A.  "Tablegard patient warming system, conductive patient

           10     warming, pressure relief and warming system are separate air

           11     supplies, closed recirculation system, no introduction of

           12     airflow to the sterile field."

           13     Q.  You can stop there.  Let me ask you this.  The fact that

           14     there is no introduction of airflow to the sterile field, is

           15     that important to you?

           16     A.  Absolutely.

           17     Q.  Why is that?

           18     A.  Because now we removed the risk that has been introduced

           19     by using the Bair Hugger from existence.

           20     Q.  Could you, with some engineering work, modify the Bair

           21     Hugger to be a Tablegard?

           22     A.  It looks to me like most of the component between the

           23     two system are common, with the exception of recirculating,

           24     meaning additional hose and nonperforated blanket keeping

           25     the hot air within the system not expelling it to around the




                                                               1064



            1     surgical site, yes, you can do that.

            2     Q.  Do you have an opinion to a reasonable degree of

            3     biomedical engineering certainty as to whether or not the

            4     Tablegard is a safer alternative design to the Bair Hugger?

            5     A.  By removing the risk that we have discussed this

            6     morning, it is a safer alternative design.

            7     Q.  I sort of just want to conclude with the summary of your

            8     opinions.  Do you have an opinion as to whether or not the

            9     Bair Hugger is unreasonably dangerous to a reasonable degree

           10     of biomedical engineering certainty?

           11     A.  I do.

           12     Q.  What's your opinion?

           13     A.  And my opinion is that the utilization of the Bair

           14     Hugger in the deep joint surgical procedures like

           15     arthroplasty is presenting hazardous condition to patient

           16     undergoing that procedures to a biomedical -- biomedical

           17     engineering probability.

           18     Q.  Does it have a design flaw --

           19               THE COURT REPORTER:  I'm sorry, I --

           20               THE WITNESS:  Engineering probability.

           21     BY MR. FARRAR:

           22     Q.  Does it have a design flaw?

           23     A.  That is design flaw.  That is design of the system to

           24     discharge hot air is a flaw.

           25     Q.  And I think we just covered this, but you believe there




                                                               1065



            1     -- do you believe there's a safer alternative design that

            2     was economically and technologically feasible in 2009?

            3     A.  I do.

            4     Q.  What is that device?

            5     A.  And the device would be Tablegard.

            6               MR. FARRAR:  Your Honor, pending one issue that if

            7     we could have a sidebar, I'm going to pass the witness, but

            8     there's one thing I want to discuss with you.

            9               THE COURT:  Sure.  Come on up.

           10                             (Sidebar.)

           11               THE COURT:  Okay.  Go ahead.

           12               MR. FARRAR:  There's --

           13               THE COURT:  I have warrants and quite a morning

           14     all told.  Anyway.

           15               MR. FARRAR:  Well, I hate to make your morning

           16     worse, and I hate to spring this on you, but we found this

           17     last night -- or two nights ago, there's a case out of South

           18     Carolina that says inadequate warning is a safer alternative

           19     design, so I want to talk about the warnings.

           20               THE COURT:  Yeah, no.

           21               MR. FARRAR:  Okay.

           22               THE COURT:  Give me the case and I'll read it and

           23     we can reopen, but I'm not going to change on that basis.

           24               MR. FARRAR:  I understand.

           25               THE COURT:  So this case -- do you have this?




                                                               1066



            1               MS. PRUITT:  I haven't seen it.

            2               MR. FARRAR:  This case, it's about a saw.

            3               THE COURT:  I'll read it.  It's U.S. District

            4     Court case?

            5               MR. FARRAR:  U.S. District Court out of South

            6     Carolina applying South Carolina law and specifically

            7     Branham which is -- -

            8               THE COURT:  Courts all over the country can apply

            9     South Carolina law.

           10               MR. FARRAR:  So I've seen.

           11               THE COURT:  Okay.  So we'll take this under

           12     advisement.

           13               MR. FARRAR:  And I want to make an offer of proof

           14     with him if the Court's not going to allow anything.  I'm

           15     going to do it, but at some point I need to do that.

           16               THE COURT:  Yes, right.

           17               MR. FARRAR:  Thanks.

           18                          (IN OPEN COURT.)

           19               THE COURT:  Mr. Farrar, all done?

           20               MR. FARRAR:  I'm all done.  Pass the witness.

           21               THE COURT:  All right.  Ms. Pruitt or Mr. Hulse.

           22               MR. HULSE:  A logistical moment.  We've just lost

           23     the realtime feed and it's going to take a minute to restore

           24     it.

           25               THE COURT:  Sure.

            1                          CROSS EXAMINATION

            2     BY MS. PRUITT:

            3     Q.  Good morning, Dr. David.

            4     A.  Good morning.

            5     Q.  We met briefly yesterday.  Is that right?

            6     A.  I believe so.

            7     Q.  My name is Lynn Pruitt, and I represent 3M, okay?

            8     A.  Okay.

            9     Q.  I want to talk to you first about the studies, the

           10     studies that you talked to the jury about this morning, and

           11     I first want to talk about the McGovern study, okay?

           12     A.  Okay.

           13     Q.  Your Honor, I have a copy of the McGovern study.  Do you

           14     know where it is there in your materials, sir?

           15     A.  I do.

           16     Q.  Can you find it?  Or would you like for me just to give

           17     you another copy?

           18     A.  Well, there are two studies.  Which one are you

           19     referring to?

           20     Q.  The one that you read from --

           21     A.  Okay.

           22     Q.  -- to the jury.

           23     A.  Okay.  I have it.

           24     Q.  Okay.  Will you take a look at page -- turn to page --

           25     so the jury is clear, this is the study that you were




                                                                1068



            1     reading from as one of the studies that you relied upon,

            2     correct?

            3     A.  Correct.

            4     Q.  Will you turn, please, to page 1543 and the pages are in

            5     the top right-hand corner, it's the next to the last page of

            6     the article?

            7     A.  I have it.

            8     Q.  And if you will look at the column on the left, the

            9     first full paragraph, the authors of this study say, This

           10     study does not establish a causal basis for this

           11     association.  Did I read that correctly?

           12     A.  You did.

           13     Q.  And what that means, it does not establish a causal

           14     basis for this association is association between the Bair

           15     Hugger and increased infections; isn't that correct?

           16     A.  That's correct.

           17     Q.  Okay.  Now, if you'll go on down to the third sentence

           18     -- well, there is no sense in going through all of this.  I

           19     would like for you to go the fourth sentence in that

           20     paragraph, please, Dr. David.  It says, In addition, we were

           21     unable to consider all factors that have been associated

           22     with surgical site infections as the details of blood

           23     transfusions, obesity, incontinence, and fitness for

           24     surgery, which have been identified elsewhere as important

           25     predictors for deep infection, were not sufficiently




                                                                1069



            1     detailed in the medical record.  Did I read that correctly?

            2     A.  You did.

            3     Q.  And you agree with those statements that are made by the

            4     authors in their own publication, don't you, sir?

            5     A.  Yes, simply saying that they have factors that are not

            6     included in the article does not change the conclusion of

            7     the study.

            8     Q.  Okay.  Well, their conclusion is the study does not

            9     establish a causal basis for this association; isn't that

           10     correct, Doctor?

           11     A.  That sentence is correct.  It does not change the

           12     conclusion of the study.  It says there are more particulate

           13     matter on the surgical site brought in from the nonsterile

           14     field.  They did not establish that this phenomena that has

           15     been established in this study correlate within infection

           16     because they did not have the tissue to sample but not

           17     because there's no particular moving against the flow of the

           18     operating room air.

           19     Q.  Let's talk about the movement for a moment, what these

           20     authors actually said about the movement.  Look at the last

           21     two sentences in the left-hand column.

           22     A.  Where?

           23     Q.  The last sentence where it states with however.

           24     However, the increasing contamination was deemed to be less

           25     than that resulting from the movement of the personnel and




                                                                1070



            1     did not exceed recommended bacterial levels.  Did I read

            2     that correctly?

            3     A.  You did.

            4     Q.  And the last sentence in that paragraph, Dr. David, the

            5     authors say, Even minor differences in factors such as

            6     draping, procedural practices, and theater dress are likely

            7     to have large effects on both floor level and under drape

            8     contaminant levels and the formation of convection currents.

            9     Did I read that correctly?

           10     A.  You did.  And the authors are appropriately recognizing

           11     all these factors and conclude that in this particular

           12     study, in this particular condition, with this particular

           13     personnel, there was significant increase in contamination

           14     between the use of forced air device and none.

           15     Q.  Because of the movement of the personnel, correct?

           16     A.  No.  It's that they're related to the use of the

           17     product.

           18     Q.  I'm not going to argue with you.  I read the study and

           19     the phrase correctly to the jury, would you agree?

           20     A.  Absolutely.

           21     Q.  Thank you.  Now, let's take a look at another study that

           22     you read from for the jury, Legg study, 2013.  Can you take

           23     a look that the one please, sir?  Last page, please.  Are

           24     you there?

           25     A.  Yes.




                                                                1071



            1     Q.  Last page, last paragraph, first sentence, This study

            2     does not show that forced air warming increases the risk of

            3     infection.  Did I read that phrase correctly?

            4     A.  You did read correctly part of the sentence.

            5     Q.  Now, you agree -- you're not telling the jury that you

            6     disagree with that part of the sentence or that phrase where

            7     the author suggested that it did not increase the risk of

            8     infection.  You agree with that, right?

            9     A.  The purpose of bringing those studies up and the

           10     reviewing them is because there is information here that an

           11     aggregate is showing the phenomena of the Bair Hugger

           12     contributing to vortices and increased particle moving from

           13     nonsterile field to sterile field.  Each of the studies have

           14     its own condition, its own operating room, and its own

           15     factors, but in general, I definitely agree with the study,

           16     and I think if you will continue the same sentence you start

           17     reading but didn't finish, you will see that the

           18     significantly disrupting airflow is in the same sentence.

           19     Q.  I'm not arguing with you about your opinions at all,

           20     Dr.  David.  What I am asking you is you agree with the

           21     authors of the Legg study in the last paragraph the first

           22     sentence where they say this study does not show that forced

           23     air warming increases the risk of infection.  Did I read it

           24     right?

           25     A.  You read part of the sentence correctly.




                                                                1072



            1     Q.  Now, Dr. David, you're not a surgeon, are you, sir?

            2     A.  I am not.

            3     Q.  And you don't regularly in your job, you didn't

            4     participate in surgical procedures in operating rooms at the

            5     Texas hospitals where you were, did you?

            6     A.  Well, it depends what you mean by participate --

            7     Q.  Well, did you --

            8     A.  -- in the operating room during procedure and during

            9     surgery, including orthopedics procedure, routinely.

           10     Q.  Let me see if I can define it for you.  Were the surgeon

           11     in any procedure?

           12     A.  Absolutely not.

           13     Q.  Were you the circulating nurse in any procedure?

           14     A.  No.

           15     Q.  Were you the scrub tech in any procedure?

           16     A.  No.

           17     Q.  Were you the scrub technician in any of the procedures?

           18     A.  No.

           19     Q.  Were you the patient in any of the procedures?

           20     A.  Thank God I was not.

           21     Q.  Now, you're also not an anesthesiologist, are you,

           22     Dr. David?

           23     A.  I am not.

           24     Q.  Okay.  And so the jury, I think they've got this, but

           25     you're not a medical doctor, you're a Ph.D. in education,




                                                                1073



            1     correct?

            2     A.  Correct.

            3     Q.  And you're not an infectious disease doctor, correct?

            4     A.  Correct.

            5     Q.  And you've not been trained in any of those fields,

            6     orthopedic, anesthesiology, or infectious disease, correct?

            7     A.  Correct.

            8     Q.  Now, you, Dr. David, have not looked at Mr. Gareis's

            9     medical records, have you, sir?

           10     A.  I did not.

           11     Q.  Or any of Mr. Gareis's laboratory tests, have you?

           12     A.  I did not.

           13     Q.  And did you know which hospital Mr. Gareis's hip surgery

           14     took place in?

           15     A.  I think I heard yesterday.  I don't have a record I

           16     reviewed to identify that.

           17     Q.  And you aren't familiar with the operating room setup

           18     for Mr. Gareis's surgery, are you, sir?

           19     A.  No.

           20     Q.  Okay.  And you have no way of knowing how many people

           21     were moving around in the operating room during Mr. Gareis's

           22     recent surgery, do you, sir?

           23     A.  Correct.

           24     Q.  And you don't know how many other machines might have

           25     been used in the surgical suite that blow air, do you, sir?




                                                                1074



            1     A.  That's correct.

            2     Q.  And you don't know even where that, whether that surgery

            3     room had laminar airflow or unidirectional airflow or what

            4     it had, do you, sir?

            5     A.  I have reviewed studies that demonstrate.

            6     Q.  No, I'm talking about OR room number 4 at Providence

            7     Hospital where Mr. Gareis had his surgery.  Do you know

            8     whether there was laminar flow or unidirectional flow or

            9     what was in that operating room?

           10     A.  I -- I know because I heard yesterday discussion about

           11     specific flow in operating room number 4.

           12     Q.  Okay.  Before yesterday when you sat in here and

           13     listened to Dr. Elghobashi, did you know whether OR4 at

           14     Providence hospital had laminar flow or unidirectional flow?

           15     A.  No.  I did not know.

           16     Q.  And so what did you hear yesterday that told you which

           17     kind of airflow system they have?

           18     A.  Discussion from Elghobashi studies and demonstration of

           19     his video.

           20     Q.  And which one was it?

           21     A.  Which one meaning what?

           22     Q.  Laminar flow or unidirectional flow?

           23     A.  Well, we using the terms over the last couple of days to

           24     describe different conditions in the surgical operating

           25     room.  My observation is that this is a unidirectional flow




                                                                1075



            1     of air in surgical procedure number 4.

            2     Q.  And your observation comes from, you heard, you think

            3     Dr. Elghobashi said yesterday that in OR4 at Providence

            4     Hospital they had unidirectional flow air.  Is that what

            5     you're telling the jury?

            6     A.  Let me try to clarify that.  My review does not have the

            7     particular dimension and geographical condition of surgical

            8     room number 4 but more of the generic phenomena of using

            9     forced air warming device in any operating room where

           10     orthopedics procedure for deep joint procedures are taking

           11     place, arthroplasty, and there is unidirectional system of

           12     air handling is used, that is my work and that's my opinion.

           13     Q.  Okay.  And do you know in OR4 at Providence Hospital the

           14     ventilation, what the ventilation in that particular

           15     operating room was like, other than what you heard in this

           16     courtroom yesterday?

           17     A.  I do not know.

           18     Q.  Okay.  Do you know what kind of infection that

           19     Mr. Gareis had?

           20     A.  No.

           21     Q.  And you are not here, Dr. David, to give opinions at all

           22     about Mr. Gareis, are you?

           23     A.  Correct.

           24     Q.  And you are not here to give opinions to the ladies and

           25     gentlemen of the jury about the cause of Mr. Gareis's




                                                                1076



            1     infection, are you, sir?

            2     A.  I'm here to give opinion about the contributing factors

            3     of using forced air heating device in such procedure.

            4     Q.  But since you haven't read his medical records and

            5     you're unfamiliar with any of the case specific facts, my

            6     question is simple, you're not here to give opinions about

            7     the cause of Mr. Gareis's infection, are you, sir?

            8     A.  I do.

            9     Q.  Did you say I do or no?

           10     A.  I said I do.

           11     Q.  You're giving opinion about Mr. Gareis's infection and

           12     you haven't looked at his medical records, correct?

           13     A.  No, that's not what I said.

           14     Q.  Okay.

           15     A.  We talked about the cause.  That's what I'm referring

           16     to.

           17     Q.  Okay.  Now, let's talk a little bit about your work

           18     history.  Was it in 2008 when you left the two hospitals in

           19     Texas, you left your work there in 2008?

           20     A.  Correct.

           21     Q.  And in 2012 you started your own consulting business.

           22     Is that right, Doctor?

           23     A.  No.  No.

           24     Q.  Okay.  Did you go to work for a consulting business?

           25     A.  No.




                                                                1077



            1     Q.  What is Biomedical Engineering Consultants, LLC?

            2     A.  This is my business.

            3     Q.  When did you start your business?

            4     A.  2008.

            5     Q.  2008.  So I was four years too late?

            6     A.  Or mistaken.

            7     Q.  Mistaken.  So let me get it right so we'll have the

            8     facts correct.  In 2008 you left your job at the Texas

            9     hospitals and you started a company called Biomedical

           10     Engineering Consultants in 2008; is that correct?

           11     A.  That is correct.

           12     Q.  Now, one of the things that you do in Biomedical

           13     Engineering Consultants is you give expert witness testimony

           14     like you're doing here today, right?

           15     A.  Right.

           16     Q.  And you've given testimony in cases between 2012 and

           17     today, you've given expert testimony in about 26 different

           18     cases, right, sir?

           19     A.  I don't have the count in front of me.

           20     Q.  Excuse me?

           21     A.  I don't have the count in front of me.

           22     Q.  Well, I have it in front of me.  Would you like to see

           23     it?

           24     A.  If you would like to ask me questions about it.

           25     Q.  Okay.  I'm counting the number of cases in which you've




                                                                1078



            1     testified as an expert witness between 2012 and today and I

            2     count 26 times.  Do you have some reason to dispute that,

            3     sir?

            4     A.  No.

            5     Q.  Okay.  And nearly -- and you've testified in these

            6     26 cases in over ten different states in this country as an

            7     expert witness, correct?

            8     A.  Possible.

            9     Q.  Okay.  How about Minnesota?  Today, there would be

           10     Minnesota, right?

           11     A.  Yes.

           12     Q.  Washington state, correct?

           13     A.  Correct.

           14     Q.  Texas, correct?

           15     A.  Correct.

           16     Q.  Missouri, correct?

           17     A.  Correct.

           18     Q.  North Carolina, correct?

           19     A.  I don't remember that one.

           20     Q.  Florida?

           21     A.  Correct.

           22     Q.  California?

           23     A.  I don't remember that one.

           24     Q.  Kansas?

           25     A.  Correct.




                                                                1079



            1     Q.  Illinois?

            2     A.  I don't believe so.

            3     Q.  Oregon?

            4     A.  I don't believe so.

            5     Q.  Okay.  So if your records here which we got from you

            6     from Biomedical Engineering Consultants reflect that you

            7     were looking at cases in Kansas and Illinois, you wouldn't

            8     have any reason to dispute your own records, would you, sir?

            9     A.  No.  You might be reading it wrong, but I don't have

           10     reason to dispute my records.

           11     Q.  Okay.  How much are you being paid for your testimony

           12     today sir?

           13     A.  I paid four hundred dollars an hour to do all work,

           14     review engineering analysis, except testimony in court I am

           15     doing now which is at rate of $450 an hour.

           16     Q.  And have you had a chance to look at your invoices to

           17     see how much you've charged in this case to give your

           18     opinion or to look at records and the things that you did?

           19     A.  I did not prepare myself for it, no, I did not.

           20     Q.  You haven't looked at your invoices?

           21     A.  Correct.

           22     Q.  I have.  Would you agree with me that you have, to date,

           23     probably either already billed, are going to bill up through

           24     today somewhere between 75 thousand and a hundred thousand

           25     dollars?




                                                                1080



            1     A.  I don't have the number in my head, but I'm working on

            2     Bair Hugger cases for three or four years, that might be

            3     reasonable.

            4     Q.  So you don't have any reason to dispute that range?

            5               THE COURT:  Hold on one second.

            6               MR. FARRAR:  It's difficult to hear Dr. David.

            7     It's really --

            8               THE WITNESS:  Sorry, sorry.

            9     BY MS. PRUITT:

           10     Q.  And so I think my last question was you don't have any

           11     reason to dispute the range that you have billed between

           12     75,000 and a hundred thousand dollars; is that correct?

           13     A.  Not one or the other because I don't have the number in

           14     my head.  I don't dispute.  I don't know if you're close or

           15     far, but it's over a four-year period.  Possible.

           16     Q.  Okay.  Now, Mr. David, prior to this litigation, you

           17     told us that the only place you had seen the Bair Hugger

           18     device was in patients' rooms, do you recall that, sir, and

           19     not necessarily in the operating room?

           20     A.  I do.

           21     Q.  And that's true, isn't it?

           22     A.  Yes, it's true.

           23     Q.  Okay.  And you never discussed the Bair Hugger system

           24     with anyone at Texas Children's or at Saint Luke's where you

           25     worked previously, have you, sir?




                                                                1081



            1     A.  Correct.

            2     Q.  And do you know whether Texas Children's uses the Bair

            3     Hugger device, sir?

            4     A.  I think to reflect correctly on what you referred during

            5     my deposition is that I didn't remember one way or the other

            6     if the Bair Hugger was a discussion between myself and other

            7     people at Texas Children Hospital and it's true to date.

            8     Q.  My question is a little bit different.  Do you know

            9     whether Texas Children's is using the Bair Hugger device

           10     today?

           11     A.  I do not.  And what I responded just a minute ago is

           12     about the previous question you asked me if I talked about

           13     the Bair Hugger at the hospitals I worked with, and I do not

           14     have recollection one way or the other.

           15     Q.  Okay.  I apologize if I confused you.  I'll try not to

           16     do that again.

           17               On Saint Luke's, do you know whether Saint Luke's

           18     has used the Bair Hugger warming device that we're talking

           19     about in this case?

           20     A.  I do not recall.

           21     Q.  And you never evaluated, Dr. David, the Bair Hugger

           22     system when you worked at Texas hospital or Saint Luke's,

           23     did you, sir?

           24     A.  I do not remember as I sit here if I did or not.  It was

           25     25 years history that ended ten years ago, so I may or may




                                                                1082



            1     not, I don't remember.

            2     Q.  Okay.  So you don't remember ever having a conversation

            3     about the Bair Hugger prior to this litigation in connection

            4     with your work in these hospitals, do you, sir?

            5     A.  That's correct, yes.

            6     Q.  And you have never operated a Bair Hugger device prior

            7     to this litigation, have you, sir?

            8     A.  That would be fair statement.

            9     Q.  You had never turned one on before this litigation, had

           10     you, sir?

           11     A.  Probably right.

           12     Q.  And you had never inspected one before this litigation,

           13     correct, sir?

           14     A.  May or may not.  As I said before, I don't recall.  We

           15     have over 20 thousand medical devices in the inventory that

           16     I was responsible for.

           17     Q.  Well, let me ask the question a different way.  In fact,

           18     you never so much as touched a Bair Hugger before plaintiffs

           19     hired you to work on this case, had you?

           20     A.  Same answer.  May or may not, I don't remember.

           21     Q.  And you've also told us that you had never evaluated a

           22     Bair Hugger blanket as part of your responsibilities, your

           23     professional responsibilities, prior to this litigation,

           24     correct?

           25     A.  That would be a fair statement.




                                                                1083



            1     Q.  That's a true statement?

            2     A.  Yes.

            3     Q.  Okay.  Do you know what type of -- you know there are

            4     different types of Bair Hugger blankets, right?

            5     A.  Correct.

            6     Q.  And you know there are all -- strike that.

            7               Do you know what type of Bair Hugger blanket was

            8     used in Mr. Gareis's surgery?

            9     A.  I do not.

           10     Q.  In fact, Dr. David, even as of today, you've never

           11     observed a Bair Hugger being used in an operating room,

           12     right, sir?

           13     A.  Observe is generic word, so the answer to this question

           14     would be yes.

           15     Q.  You have not?

           16     A.  I just said yes, I did.

           17     Q.  And I'm confused on your answer.  You say you have

           18     observed it or you have not observed it?

           19     A.  Since you haven't defined observed, I said yes, I did.

           20     I did observe.

           21     Q.  Okay.  So you have been in an OR when they applied a

           22     Bair Hugger blanket to a patient and observed the use of the

           23     actual Bair Hugger blanket?

           24     A.  No, I observed video of Bair Hugger used in the OR room.

           25     Q.  Okay.  And when did you do that?




                                                                1084



            1     A.  When?  For the past four years I did several times.

            2     Q.  You did it in connection with this litigation, correct?

            3     A.  Yes.

            4     Q.  Okay.  Now, Mr. David, when you did your -- you looked

            5     at the Bair Hugger.  When you did that, you obtained a model

            6     750 Bair Hugger device from eBay, correct?

            7     A.  Correct.

            8     Q.  And this particular device that we're talking about in

            9     this case is not the 750 Bair Hugger device, correct?

           10     A.  Correct.

           11     Q.  And the reason you obtained a 750 device is because the

           12     lawyers said that that was the product that they wanted you

           13     to give an opinion about; is that right?

           14     A.  That's right.  My report is addressing the family of

           15     Bair Hugger devices, including the 500 series.

           16     Q.  Okay.  But you never looked at the 505 series and done

           17     what you told the jury you had done to inspect this Bair

           18     Hugger system, have you, sir?

           19     A.  No, that would not be a fair statement because I

           20     reviewed significant amount of technical literature and

           21     documents that there were provided during discovery

           22     brochures and similar references to the 500 family as well

           23     as to the 700 family of Bair Huggers.

           24     Q.  And my question is a little bit simpler than that.  Did

           25     you get off of eBay the 505 Bair Hugger that I'm holding in




                                                                1085



            1     my hands and examine it and do the things that you've told

            2     the jury about with a 505 machine?

            3     A.  I did not because I reviewed all the literature, as I

            4     just said, for the 500 series as well as for the 700, and I

            5     understand the differences to be mainly --

            6     Q.  I didn't ask you what the differences were, Doctor.  My

            7     next question is you understand -- excuse me, sir, there's

            8     not a question.

            9     A.  You interrupted my answer.

           10               MS. PRUITT:  Your Honor.

           11               THE COURT:  Next question.

           12     BY MS. PRUITT:

           13     Q.  You understand that the Model 505 is the one that was

           14     being used in Mr. Gareis's surgery, correct?

           15     A.  Correct.

           16     Q.  Now, plaintiffs' counsel purchased this 750 model Bair

           17     Hugger and delivered it to you, right?

           18     A.  Correct.

           19     Q.  And you also received a blanket from counsel, correct?

           20     A.  Correct.

           21     Q.  And you don't know where the blanket you looked at came

           22     from, do you, sir?  Other than it was given to you by

           23     plaintiffs' counsel?

           24     A.  I agree with it.

           25     Q.  You agree with that?




                                                                1086



            1     A.  Yes.

            2     Q.  Okay.  Now, do you know what type of blanket it was that

            3     you were investigating?  Which type of Bair Hugger blanket

            4     it was?

            5     A.  It's in my report.

            6     Q.  The blanket is?

            7     A.  Yes.

            8     Q.  Okay.  Would you mind showing it to me, please, sir?

            9     A.  You're right.  I couldn't find the description of the

           10     blanket in my report.  However, I still have it and I can

           11     identify it.

           12     Q.  Now, when you got this machine that the plaintiffs'

           13     lawyer got off of eBay, the 750, and you looked at it, you

           14     noted that the machine had been in operation for 5,260

           15     hours; is that right?

           16     A.  That number seems to be reasonable.  I don't recall the

           17     exact.  It's in my report.

           18     Q.  Okay.  And you had no idea how that particular machine

           19     had performed in the past, did you, sir?

           20     A.  Well, there was a history recorded in the device memory.

           21     I could see records of errors.

           22     Q.  Errors, is that what you said?

           23     A.  Yes.

           24     Q.  Okay.  And because of the way the model 750 looked when

           25     you received it, Dr. David, you assumed that the device that




                                                                1087



            1     you looked at had been used on the floor of the operating

            2     room, correct?

            3     A.  No, I read literature and description of a material

            4     through discovery and over and over the description was of

            5     laying the Bair Hugger on the operating room floor, so I

            6     took that as the position to be used.  I do know that there

            7     is an IV clamp and the product can be positioned above the

            8     floor.

            9     Q.  Okay.  Well, you stated in your report, Dr. David, that

           10     you turned the 750 over and looked at the feet on it and

           11     then wore down which indicated to you that that particular

           12     machine had been used on the floor; isn't that correct?  And

           13     you took a picture of it?

           14     A.  I took and picture a reasonable assumption, yes.

           15     Q.  Okay.  So your assumption for that machine is it had

           16     been used sitting on the floor, correct, based on the

           17     condition which you found it?

           18     A.  I don't know if I concluded where it was positioned, but

           19     it's a reasonable assumption.

           20     Q.  Okay.  Did you tell us under oath that because of the

           21     wear and tear of the four feet on the bottom of the Bair

           22     Hugger machine, it indicated to you that it had been sitting

           23     on the floor, used on the floor?

           24     A.  It sounds reasonable to me.

           25     Q.  Okay.  Now, do you have any information as to how the




                                                                1088



            1     505 Bair Hugger in Mr. Gareis's operation was used as far as

            2     where it sat in relationship to the rest of the equipment

            3     and so forth in the operating room?

            4     A.  I do not.

            5     Q.  You yourself, Dr. David, did not attempt to study the

            6     effect of the Bair Hugger warming unit on airflow in a room,

            7     did you, sir?

            8     A.  I believe I did.

            9     Q.  You didn't do any of the similar studies like

           10     Dr. Elghobashi, did you?

           11     A.  No, I rely on other experts.

           12     Q.  And that's what I'm asking you, you yourself didn't at

           13     tempt to study the effect of the Bair Hugger warming unit on

           14     airflow or by some experiment or something like that, did

           15     you, sir?

           16     A.  I did not.

           17     Q.  But you did, as a part of your inspection, do some

           18     temperature testing of the air coming out of the Bair Hugger

           19     blanket, right?

           20     A.  Correct.

           21     Q.  And if you look at page -- do you have your report up

           22     there with you?

           23     A.  No.

           24     Q.  I'll bring it to you.  You'll turn with me to page 15 of

           25     your expert report, please, sir.




                                                                1089



            1     A.  Thank you.  I'm there.

            2     Q.  You beat me so I'm getting there.  Page 15, look at the

            3     last sentence of the first paragraph, please.  When I

            4     measured several areas of a sample blanket after 30 minutes

            5     of operation, I found an average temperature of 36 degrees,

            6     correct?

            7     A.  You're very correct.

            8     Q.  And 36 degrees, that's 36 degrees Celsius, right?

            9     A.  Correct.

           10     Q.  And 36 degrees Celsius is the same as 96.8 degrees

           11     Fahrenheit, correct?

           12     A.  That's correct.

           13     Q.  And your measurements of the temperature were right

           14     underneath the blanket, correct?

           15     A.  Correct.

           16     Q.  Now, let's talk about the environment of use.  I heard

           17     you tell the jury that that's one of the things that you

           18     considered in giving your opinion today, the environment of

           19     use, correct?

           20     A.  Correct.

           21     Q.  And in order to assess the risk and benefits of a

           22     particular medical product, it's important to understand the

           23     environment of use, correct?

           24     A.  Correct.

           25     Q.  And the environment of use in this case is the operating




                                                                1090



            1     room, right?

            2     A.  More specifically orthopedic procedures.

            3               THE COURT REPORTER:  I'm sorry?

            4               THE WITNESS:  More specifically orthopedic

            5     procedures.

            6     BY MS. PRUITT:

            7     Q.  And you don't know what environment the Bair Hugger

            8     device that you looked at, the 750, you don't know what

            9     environment it was used in, do you, sir?

           10     A.  The need for me to look at operation of the Bair Hugger

           11     is to look at the overall functionality of the device, so

           12     when you continuously asking me if it was on the floor, in

           13     the air or if it was a device or not, this was not the focus

           14     of my study but rather the principle engineering phenomena

           15     of what forced air warming device does in the operating room

           16     in this specific procedures.

           17     Q.  So my question is simply this, you never saw the Bair

           18     Hugger that you looked at in its environment of use,

           19     correct?

           20     A.  Inside the word observation if you exclude videos and

           21     TVs and other film and other things that I watched and

           22     observed, then it's correct.

           23               MR. FARRAR:  And I don't mean to interrupt.  I

           24     think his mic is off is why it's really difficult to hear.

           25     I just want to make sure we can all here what he is saying.




                                                                1091



            1     I don't know if you have the buttons up there that can fix

            2     it.

            3               THE COURT:  I wonder if that's related to the --

            4     well, just try and keep your voice up.

            5               THE WITNESS:  I will speak louder.

            6     BY MS. PRUITT:

            7     Q.  Once again, I think you didn't answer my question, so

            8     let me ask it again.

            9               THE COURT:  We could give him the interpreter's

           10     mic.

           11     BY MS. PRUITT:

           12     Q.  So my question was you never saw the 750 Bair Hugger in

           13     its environment of use, did you, sir, that you inspected?

           14     A.  Correct.

           15     Q.  And you didn't see the Bair Hugger, the 505 model, that

           16     was used in Mr. Gareis's surgery in its environment of use

           17     either, did you, sir?

           18     A.  Correct.

           19     Q.  Now, Mr. David, your work in hospitals involved

           20     considering the benefits of medical technologies too, didn't

           21     it?

           22     A.  Of course.

           23     Q.  And in this situation, if you're making a decision as to

           24     whether to purchase a device, it would be relevant for you

           25     to consider the benefits of that particular device, correct?




                                                                1092



            1     A.  Absolutely.

            2     Q.  And you agree, Dr. David, that patient warming during

            3     surgery is a very important part of maintaining a patient's

            4     condition following surgery, right?

            5     A.  No, I don't have opinion.  This is outside my field of

            6     expertise and therefore, in reviewing the risk to benefit

            7     ratio, I rely on other experts to give me their opinion on

            8     the benefits.

            9     Q.  Okay.  Let's take a look at your deposition, please.

           10               And can you turn, please -- that's not you.  Yours

           11     is right behind the report where it says report, Doctor.  Do

           12     you see that?

           13     A.  I do.

           14     Q.  Okay.  And if you would turn, please, to page 202,

           15     line 24, please, sir.  The pages are up in the right-hand

           16     corner.

           17     A.  I'm there.

           18     Q.  Now, the question that was asked, if I'm reading to

           19     correctly, and I'm going to read it, you tell me if it's

           20     correct, question, What did you review related to patient

           21     warming prior to your work in this case?  Did I read that

           22     correctly?

           23     A.  Page 202?

           24     Q.  Page 202 at the bottom, lines 23, 24, and 25.

           25     A.  Oh, line 24, okay, yes.




                                                                1093



            1     Q.  The question was, What did you reviewed related to

            2     patient warming prior to your work in this case?  The

            3     answer, the next page of the answer, Patient warming is it a

            4     very important part of maintaining patient condition during

            5     disease management and following surgery or during trauma,

            6     so as part of my responsibility as director of biomedical

            7     engineering, I was involved in reviewing warming devices for

            8     adults and pediatric patients and it goes on.

            9               MR. FARRAR:  Your Honor, for completeness, I would

           10     ask that the entire answer be read.

           11               MS. PRUITT:  I'm just trying to save time, Your

           12     Honor, but I'll be glad to read it.

           13     BY MS. PRUITT:

           14     Q.  I was involved in reviewing warming devices for adults

           15     and pediatric patients using either a literally oven-warmed

           16     blanket or devices that use fluids to warm patients or cool

           17     them or radiation-based devices that are used in different

           18     environments.

           19               MR. FARRAR:  There's a lot more to the answer.

           20     Again, out of completeness, I would like the whole answer

           21     read.

           22               MS. PRUITT:  Your Honor, it goes on for four

           23     pages.

           24               THE COURT:  All right, all right.

           25               MR. FARRAR:  It's one more page, Your Honor.




                                                                1094



            1               THE COURT:  The objection is overruled.  Or to the

            2     extent you can go to, I don't want four pages, but if

            3     there's a concept we can come to the end of.

            4               MR. FARRAR:  Well, Your Honor, it's one more page,

            5     it's not four, and I think his whole answer puts that in

            6     context as to what he warns --

            7               THE COURT:  Why don't you do that on redirect.

            8     BY MS. PRUITT:

            9     Q.  Okay.  So my question to you is, you said under oath

           10     when you gave your deposition that patient warming is a very

           11     important part of maintaining patient condition during

           12     disease management and following surgery.  You still agree

           13     with that today, correct, sir?

           14     A.  I agree with that because that's what I hear from the

           15     expert.

           16     Q.  Okay.  Thank you.  And you've heard from the experts

           17     that hypothermia can be serious, correct?

           18     A.  Again, depends on the medical condition on the

           19     individual patient and the environment where it's used, yes.

           20     Q.  And you agree, Dr. David, that hearing from the experts

           21     that there are many studies that discuss the benefits of

           22     preventing hypothermia, correct?

           23     A.  As long as they're safe, yes.

           24     Q.  And you don't dispute, Dr. David, that preventing

           25     hypothermia results in clinical benefits for patients, do




                                                                1095



            1     you, sir?

            2     A.  I will defer that to the expert.

            3     Q.  Well, let me just ask it this way.  You looked at this

            4     Tablegard device; is that correct?

            5     A.  Correct.

            6     Q.  And let's look at Plaintiffs' Exhibit, I'm referring to

            7     the Tablegard brochure, if you could find that in your book,

            8     please, sir.

            9               MR. FARRAR:  1304.

           10               MS. PRUITT:  What's the number, 1304.

           11     BY Ms. PRUITT:

           12     Q.  And you were talking about -- do you have it yet,

           13     Doctor?

           14     A.  I do.

           15     Q.  Okay.  If you'll take a look with me, please, there

           16     under patient warming on page 3 of that document, sir.  And

           17     read with me, if you will, please.  The combination of

           18     anesthetic-induced impairment of thermoregulatory control

           19     and exposure to a cool operating room environment causes

           20     most surgical patients to become hypothermic.  Did I read

           21     that correctly?

           22     A.  You did.

           23     Q.  The effects of hypothermia can increase the incidence of

           24     post-operative wound infections.  Did I read that correctly?

           25     A.  You did.




                                                                1096



            1     Q.  Increase incidence of post-operative myocardial events.

            2     Did I read that correctly?

            3     A.  You did.

            4     Q.  And increase perioperative blood loss.  Did I read that

            5     correctly?

            6     A.  You did.

            7     Q.  And prolonged postoperative recovery and the duration of

            8     action of almost all anesthetic drugs.  Did I read that

            9     correctly?

           10     A.  You did.

           11     Q.  And so when you were examining the Tablegard and telling

           12     the jury that the Tablegard is an alternative device to the

           13     Bair Hugger, you agree that warming with a Tablegard and

           14     warming with the Bair Hugger provides these benefits to

           15     patients, correct, sir?

           16     A.  Except that I have to correct your statement.  I didn't

           17     say alternative design.  I said alternative safer design.

           18     This is the big difference.

           19     Q.  Okay.  Okay.  And my question is, when you looked at

           20     this brochure for the Tablegard, it talks about the benefits

           21     of warming with a Tablegard, correct?

           22     A.  Correct.

           23     Q.  And the benefits of warming with the Bair Hugger and the

           24     Tablegard are as listed in that brochure that you've relied

           25     on in giving your opinions, correct?




                                                                1097



            1     A.  Correct.  But again, I refer to the expert about

            2     temperature management of patient under certain conditions.

            3     Q.  And to be clear, Dr. David, you have never designed as a

            4     biomedical engineer a patient warming device, have you, sir?

            5     A.  That's a fair statement.

            6     Q.  You've never built a patient warming device, have you,

            7     sir?

            8     A.  That is not correct.

            9     Q.  You have built a patient warming device?

           10     A.  I participant in the development and construction of a

           11     patient warming device, yes.

           12     Q.  The device that you told the jury about, the Tablegard,

           13     you referred to it as a closed recirculation system,

           14     correct?

           15     A.  Correct.

           16     Q.  And you testified and told the jury that you think the

           17     Bair Hugger could be redesigned to have a closed

           18     recirculation system that provides conductive warming,

           19     right?

           20     A.  Right.

           21     Q.  Now, let's look at, please, if we could -- we've got the

           22     slides?  Okay.  If we could, look at -- bring up slide 5

           23     please, Brett.

           24               This is the Tablegard; isn't that correct, sir?

           25     A.  That's part of the system, yes.




                                                                1098



            1     Q.  Okay.  And if you'll take a look there, on the left-hand

            2     side, your left, you see those air vents there in the

            3     Tablegard?

            4     A.  I do.

            5     Q.  And so the Tablegard blows air through those vents,

            6     doesn't it?

            7     A.  I don't believe it's blowing.  This is allowing air to

            8     empty from the enclosure.

            9     Q.  Okay.  Air comes out of those vents, doesn't it?

           10     A.  Correct.

           11     Q.  Correct?

           12     A.  Correct.

           13     Q.  Okay.  Now let's look at slide 6, please.  You saw this

           14     in the brochure, didn't you, sir?  This is the inside of the

           15     Tablegard.  You saw that, right?

           16     A.  Not exactly the same photograph but I saw similar.

           17     Q.  Okay.  So you see that this cover is something you zip

           18     around this thing that has these air bubbles or air pockets

           19     in them --

           20     A.  Air cylinders.

           21     Q.  -- right?  Air cylinders, thank you.  And then there's a

           22     cover that goes over it and zips up, correct?

           23     A.  Correct.

           24     Q.  And you'd agree that the cover in this picture is

           25     reusable, it's used patient after patient, correct?




                                                                1099



            1     A.  Correct.

            2     Q.  And you agree that these rows of air cylinders, they

            3     deflate and reinflate on a cycle while this particular

            4     mattress is in use.  Is that correct, sir?

            5     A.  There is a mode to do this, if you choose to apply it,

            6     it will do it.  If you choose to cease, it will not do it.

            7     Q.  Okay.  Let's look at slide 7, please.  Now, the air

            8     cylinders change air, if it's being used, it changes air and

            9     those cylinders inflate and then de-inflate and inflate and

           10     then de-inflate, different ones at different times, correct

           11     sir?

           12     A.  If you choose the mode, yes, it will do that.

           13     Q.  Because this device, the Tablegard, is actually a

           14     pressure relieving mattress of sorts, isn't it, sir?

           15     A.  Including that feature, yes.

           16     Q.  And a pressure relieving mattress of sorts, usually a

           17     patient's laying on their back on the top of this mattress,

           18     correct?

           19     A.  Can lie in any position desirable.

           20     Q.  Okay.  This particular demonstrative shows the patient

           21     lying on his or her back, correct, on the screen?

           22     A.  In this particular drawing, yes, but the bed can be used

           23     in prone, supine, sitting, any position you want.

           24     Q.  We'll talk about that in a minute.  You can take the

           25     picture down.




                                                                1100



            1               Now, when somebody has -- did you know what

            2     position somebody's in when they're having a right hip

            3     replacement surgery?

            4     A.  On their side.

            5     Q.  On the left side?

            6     A.  Depending what side the procedure is on.

            7     Q.  I'm sorry.  If you're having a right hip replacement

            8     surgery, you would be lying on your left side, correct?

            9     A.  That would make sense, yes.

           10     Q.  And so in your scenario using the Tablegard, this

           11     patient is going to be lying on their side and the heating

           12     element from this blanket is going to only be on that side

           13     of their body, correct?

           14     A.  That's correct.

           15     Q.  You were the equipment manager for two hospitals for

           16     25 years, correct?

           17     A.  I don't know what equipment manager is.  I was director

           18     of biomedical engineering.

           19     Q.  You were director of biomedical engineering for

           20     25 years, right?

           21     A.  Right.

           22     Q.  And did you ever see a Tablegard used back then?

           23     A.  Not that I recall.

           24     Q.  Okay.  You have never operated a Tablegard system, have

           25     you, sir?




                                                                1101



            1     A.  Correct.

            2     Q.  You've never seen a Tablegard system in person, have

            3     you, sir?

            4     A.  Correct.

            5     Q.  And you have never tested the Tablegard's warming

            6     capabilities, correct?

            7     A.  Correct.

            8     Q.  You don't know, Dr. David, if the Tablegard is worse at

            9     warming than the Bair Hugger, correct?

           10     A.  No, the literature, the scientific study that I reviewed

           11     talking about conductive heating devices such as the

           12     Tablegard and compare that to forced air warming devices and

           13     found to be same effect.

           14     Q.  This is my question, listen carefully please, sir.  Is

           15     there a study, a head-to-head comparison, between the

           16     Tablegard and the Bair Hugger that shows the Tablegard is as

           17     effective at warming a patient as the Bair Hugger?

           18     A.  Specifically by brand name, I did not find, but the

           19     principle of heating, I think we covered those.

           20     Q.  Do you know how long the Tablegard was on the market,

           21     sir?

           22     A.  I believe it's still on.

           23     Q.  And why do you believe that?

           24     A.  Because last time I reviewed the online, I was able to

           25     find the device.




                                                                1102



            1     Q.  Okay.  Do you know whether the Tablegard was

            2     commercially available for sale in April of 2009 or November

            3     of 2010?

            4     A.  It was commercially available for sale since 2008.

            5     Q.  Do you know whether it was commercially available for

            6     sale in the United States in 2009 and 2010?

            7     A.  I do not know that.

            8     Q.  Okay.  Do you know when the patent for the Tablegard was

            9     dated?  Have you looked at the patent information?

           10     A.  I did not.

           11     Q.  I'm putting on the screen the United States patent.

           12               MR. FARRAR:  Your Honor, I'm going to object to

           13     hearsay and undisclosed.

           14               THE COURT:  Overruled.

           15               MS. PRUITT:  This is cross-examination, Your

           16     Honor.

           17               THE COURT:  Overruled.

           18     BY MS. PRUITT:

           19     Q.  And is the date of this patent June the 10th, 2014?  Do

           20     you see that up there in the upper right corner?

           21     A.  I do.

           22     Q.  And do you see here in the abstract where they say, This

           23     is described mattress system comprising a mattress and an

           24     airflow driving device and a heat adjustment unit.  The

           25     mattress has a mattress cover enclosing an internal mattress




                                                                1103



            1     such that a mattress air chamber is formed between the

            2     internal mattress and the mattress cover.  Did I read that

            3     correctly?

            4     A.  You did.

            5               MR. FARRAR:  Your Honor, can I just have a copy?

            6               THE COURT:  You may.

            7     BY MS. PRUITT:

            8     Q.  Now, is it your experience that products in the United

            9     States could become available, commercially available,

           10     without the finalization of the patent?

           11     A.  Sure.

           12     Q.  Sure they do?

           13     A.  Absolutely.

           14     Q.  What evidence or data do you have, Dr. David, to show

           15     that the Tablegard was being sold in the United States in

           16     April of 2009 and November of 2010?

           17     A.  The brochure that we just looked at.

           18     Q.  Let's look at that brochure again.  I'll put it up on

           19     the -- do you see the date on this brochure, Dr. David?

           20     A.  Usually if you look at the last page where the credit

           21     for the printer is given, there will be a date there on this

           22     brochure.  If you look on the bottom right-hand side.

           23     Q.  Which page, sir?

           24     A.  The last page.  You have on the bottom of the right-hand

           25     side the description that says 5M slash 4-09.




                                                                1104



            1     Q.  I see it.

            2     A.  This is April 2009 when the brochure was printed.

            3     Q.  Okay.  So based on your review of this brochure

            4     material, you think this brochure was printed in 2009?

            5     A.  Correct.

            6     Q.  And is that the basis for you saying that you think the

            7     Tablegard was commercially available in the United States in

            8     2009 and 2010?

            9     A.  The point for me is regardless --

           10     Q.  Can you answer my question first, please, sir?  Is that

           11     the basis --

           12     A.  I'm trying to answer your question.  To answer your

           13     question, the point for me is that we have a commercially

           14     available product at the time of Mr. Gareis's procedures

           15     that has the features that are presenting safer alternative

           16     design.  If it was available in the United States or in

           17     Europe or in Australia, it is secondary to the idea that

           18     here's a concept that materialized into a commercial

           19     product, and that would be important to me.

           20     Q.  Okay.  Do you remember what my question was?

           21     A.  Yes.

           22     Q.  Is the basis for you telling the jury that this product

           23     was commercially available in November of 2010 this

           24     marketing brochure?

           25     A.  Yes.




                                                                1105



            1     Q.  Any other basis that you have for telling the jury that

            2     this product was available in November of 2010 other than

            3     the marketing brochure which is Plaintiffs' 1304?

            4               MR. FARRAR:  Your Honor, I object.  I'd like to

            5     approach for this objection.

            6               THE COURT:  All right.

            7                              (Sidebar.)

            8               MR. FARRAR:  The basis is 510(k) approved in 2008

            9     which is not in the case.

           10               THE COURT:  I already said you can have that.  All

           11     he has to do is say it's 510(k).  Yeah, it's very clearly

           12     said yes.

           13               MR. FARRAR:  I just didn't want to do that and

           14     that every FDA --

           15               THE COURT:  No, I think we covered that.

           16               MS. PRUITT:  I'll do it.

           17               THE COURT:  Do it however.

           18                           (IN OPEN COURT.)

           19               THE COURT:  But the question may be answered.  The

           20     question was, tell me if this was the last question, any

           21     other basis that you have for telling the jury that this

           22     product was available in November 2010 other than the

           23     marketing brochure which is Plaintiffs' 1304.  Is that the

           24     question on the table?

           25               MS. PRUITT:  Yes, Your Honor.




                                                                1106



            1               THE COURT:  Okay.  You can answer that question.

            2               THE WITNESS:  I don't have other sources.

            3     BY MS. PRUITT:

            4     Q.  Okay.  Now, you know that the Tablegard was approved by

            5     the FDA, correct?

            6     A.  Correct.

            7     Q.  And that was in 2008, correct?

            8     A.  Correct.

            9     Q.  And you also know that the Bair Hugger has been approved

           10     by the FDA, correct?

           11               MR. FARRAR:  Your Honor, objection, 50 --

           12               THE COURT:  Overruled.

           13               THE WITNESS:  Correct.

           14     BY MS. PRUITT:

           15     Q.  Thank you.  Now, I think I already asked this question,

           16     I apologize if I'm repeating, you haven't tested a

           17     Tablegard, have you, sir?

           18     A.  That's true.

           19     Q.  Okay.  And you thought it was important to inspect the

           20     Bair Hugger during your work in this litigation but you

           21     haven't inspected the Tablegard, have you, sir?

           22     A.  Correct.

           23     Q.  Do you know how many times, Dr. David, that a Tablegard

           24     has been used in orthopedic surgery?

           25     A.  How many times, no.




                                                                1107



            1     Q.  Do you have any evidence, sir, that it has ever been

            2     used in an orthopedic surgery?

            3     A.  I don't -- no, I don't know that.

            4     Q.  Can you name a single hospital or doctor that you're

            5     aware of that uses a Tablegard today in orthopedic surgeries

            6     such as total hip replacements?

            7     A.  Counsel, I think in general I don't have list of

            8     physicians and the devices they are using, regardless if

            9     it's a Tablegard or infusion pump or tongue depressors, I

           10     don't have that information.

           11     Q.  And that's all I want to know.  You don't know whether

           12     there's a single hospital or doctor that has ever used the

           13     Tablegard in orthopedic surgeries, do you, sir?

           14     A.  I don't have one way or the other.

           15     Q.  You have no idea, Dr. David, whether orthopedic surgeons

           16     would be willing to use this proposed modified Bair Hugger

           17     system that you suggest in total hip replacement surgeries,

           18     do you?

           19     A.  I believe that their concern for patient safety will

           20     encourage them to use the modified version.

           21     Q.  You would encourage them to use it or you would in

           22     encourage them to consider using it?

           23     A.  I didn't say that I will do it.  I think once they

           24     become aware of the vulnerability they would be encouraged.

           25     Q.  Okay.  And they've been aware of this liability,




                                                                1108



            1     according to your testimony since 2008, correct?

            2     A.  I don't know who read the brochure from the orthopedic

            3     surgeon community.

            4     Q.  Okay.  Now, you yourself did not attempt to modify the

            5     Bair Hugger 750 that you had to incorporate the Tablegard

            6     design, did you, sir?

            7     A.  Correct, I did not.

            8     Q.  And you did not attempt to modify the Bair Hugger system

            9     to incorporate the recirculation of air that you described

           10     for the jury, did you, sir?

           11     A.  Correct, I did not.

           12     Q.  And you would agree that you did not attempt to modify

           13     the Bair Hugger system to use a non-perforated blanket,

           14     right?

           15     A.  Right.

           16     Q.  And you agree with me, Dr. David, that there is no data

           17     to show, data, to show whether your proposed modifications

           18     to the Bair Hugger system would render it less effective at

           19     warming patients, right?

           20     A.  Your question was a bit too long for me to --

           21     Q.  Okay.  Let me see if I can break it down.  You agree

           22     there's no data to show whether your modification that you

           23     told the jury about to the Bair Hugger would render it less

           24     effective in warming patients?

           25     A.  In warming patient?




                                                                1109



            1     Q.  Yes, sir.

            2     A.  I think that we just covered today studies that shows

            3     the comparison of effectiveness between forced air warming

            4     device and conductive heating device that is described here

            5     in the Tablegard.

            6     Q.  I'm talking about the Tablegard and the Bair Hugger,

            7     okay?

            8     A.  Okay.

            9     Q.  There's no data to show whether your proposed

           10     modifications to the Bair Hugger would render it less

           11     effective in warming patients, is there, sir?

           12     A.  Yeah, you're right.

           13     Q.  And you have no idea whether your proposed -- strike

           14     that.  You are not aware of any data that demonstrates that

           15     infection rates when the Tablegard is used are less than

           16     they are when the Bair Hugger is used, do you, sir?

           17     A.  Yes, I do.  And the studies are specifically comparing

           18     forced air warming device like the Bair Hugger with other

           19     principal of heating patients that do not expel warm air

           20     into the surgical site.  In all these studies, without

           21     exception, the infection rate has been reduced when air has

           22     not been expelled around the surgical site.

           23     Q.  You're talking about the particle studies, correct,

           24     Legg, that you referred to earlier today, correct?

           25     A.  Those are some of the studies, yes.




                                                                1110



            1     Q.  About particles?

            2     A.  I didn't hear that.

            3     Q.  About particles?

            4     A.  Correct.

            5     Q.  Okay.  Now, please listen to my question because it was

            6     very --

            7     A.  The studies included infection rates specifically, not

            8     just particles.

            9     Q.  Okay.  My question was very specific.  Do you have

           10     anything that compares the Tablegard to the Bair Hugger 505

           11     that demonstrates the infection rates are different for the

           12     Tablegard than for the Bair Hugger?  Do you have a

           13     head-to-head comparison?

           14     A.  I hear you clearly, counsel, and I think that I'm trying

           15     to respond to you the best I can, and that is studies of

           16     similar principle of heating without expelling warm air

           17     around surgical site are showing significant difference of a

           18     ratio of four to one when none circulated warm air device

           19     are used versus circulated air.  If you want to call it

           20     Tablegard or other names, feel free to do that, but the

           21     principal operation, that's my point today in my testimony.

           22     Q.  Do any of those studies you're referring to include

           23     looking at, analyzing, and gathering data on a Tablegard?

           24     A.  Specifically on the brand name, no.

           25     Q.  On the machine that we've about talking about and you




                                                                1111



            1     say is a better alternative?

            2     A.  Specifically on the brand name, they do not.  On the

            3     principle of recirculating warm air, they do.

            4     Q.  And so I'm correct that there's no head-to-head

            5     comparison between the Tablegard and the Bair Hugger,

            6     correct?

            7     A.  If you modify it with brand name only and not the

            8     principle of functionality, then you're correct.

            9     Q.  Have you asked -- do you know whether Providence

           10     Hospital Northeast, whether it has ever used the Tablegard

           11     in orthopedic surgeries?

           12     A.  I did not ask that.

           13     Q.  And your report includes everything that you've relied

           14     on in giving your opinions today, correct?

           15     A.  Correct.

           16     Q.  And in your report, you didn't identify any clinical

           17     data that would suggest there is a difference in infection

           18     risk between the Bair Hugger and the Tablegard, did you,

           19     sir?

           20     A.  My report includes such data for the principle of

           21     circulating warm air versus non-circulating warm air.  It

           22     does not have a Tablegard brand name.

           23     Q.  Okay.  And my question --

           24     A.  It is like you comparing sports car to another sports

           25     car.  It's same principle, maybe one is called Porsche, the




                                                                1112



            1     other one called Corvette, whatever, but the principle of

            2     the sports car is the same.

            3     Q.  Will you turn to your deposition, sir, if you would.

            4     It's page 282, please, sir.  And if would you please let me

            5     know when you're there.

            6     A.  In my deposition?  Where do I find my deposition?

            7     Q.  Yes, it's that notebook that I handed you?  Did I take

            8     it back?  It's under the first tab.

            9     A.  Okay.

           10     Q.  And it's page 282.

           11     A.  22?

           12     Q.  282.

           13     A.  I'm there.

           14     Q.  If you'll look at line 18, please, sir.  The question

           15     was, Is there any clinical data you're aware of that would

           16     suggest there's a difference in infection risk between the

           17     Bair Hugger device and any other patient warming device that

           18     you have identified in your report?  Answer, I didn't find

           19     it, so everything that I did is in my report.  Did I read

           20     that correctly?

           21     A.  You did.

           22     Q.  Now, Mr. David, would you agree that an operating room

           23     contains many devices that are not sterile, correct?

           24     A.  Correct.

           25     Q.  And many of those devices have or can have bacteria




                                                                1113



            1     present on them, correct?

            2     A.  Correct.

            3     Q.  And you told us during your deposition, sir, that you

            4     yourself have never seen an orthopedic surgery in progress,

            5     right?

            6     A.  I don't remember saying that.

            7     Q.  Have you seen an orthopedic surgery in progress?  I'm

            8     sorry, this says you have seen an orthopedic surgery in

            9     progress.  I apologize.  You have seen an orthopedic surgery

           10     in progress, right?

           11     A.  I agree with that.

           12     Q.  And you also said that the jury might be surprised or

           13     shocked to learn how much activity goes on during an

           14     orthopedic surgery, correct?

           15     A.  Probably right.

           16     Q.  And you even said that there can be so many drills and

           17     saws being used in orthopedic surgery that it is like a

           18     spare parts garage, correct?  Those aren't my words.

           19     A.  I accept that.

           20     Q.  That's what you said, isn't it, sir?

           21     A.  Yes.

           22     Q.  And some of the equipment, the drills and saws, are

           23     electrical and can cause particles to be released and fly

           24     into the air, correct?

           25     A.  Correct.




                                                                1114



            1     Q.  And at times you even see these particles get released

            2     into the air, right?

            3     A.  Right.

            4     Q.  So you agree that the air in the operating room is not

            5     sterile, right?

            6     A.  I agree.

            7     Q.  And you agree that the people in the operating room are

            8     not sterile, right?

            9     A.  Well, I don't know what's under the sterile garment, but

           10     they're all covered with gloves and shoes, with sterile

           11     garments.

           12     Q.  Well, they dress -- they don't dress right around the

           13     table, put on their covers up, do they, sir?

           14     A.  No.

           15     Q.  In the sterile field?  They get dressed back here in

           16     another part, well hopefully not with each other, in another

           17     place and they wear their clothes into the sterile field,

           18     correct, their surgical clothes?

           19     A.  You're almost correct because they put the scrub where

           20     you said in another area, they walk in and then there's

           21     another sterile suit they are putting on.

           22     Q.  Right.  And they don't put that on in the sterile field,

           23     they put it on outside in another part of the operating

           24     room, correct?

           25     A.  Right.




                                                             1115



            1     Q.  And so they walk from a nonsterile part of the surgical

            2     field into the sterile field, correct?

            3     A.  Correct.

            4               MS. PRUITT:  That's all I have.  Thank you,

            5     Doctor.

            6               THE COURT:  Mr. Farrar?

            7                        REDIRECT EXAMINATION

            8     BY MR. FARRAR:

            9     Q.  Dr. David, I have too many notebooks.  Oh, here it is.

           10     Sort of start from the back and go to the forward.  You were

           11     asked a question about whether or not you have a study

           12     showing that the use of Bair Hugger causes infections and

           13     you were read some deposition testimony but sort of cut you

           14     off before you talked about McGovern, so if you would look

           15     at your deposition again, and I want to you keep reading,

           16     you can read to yourself page 283.

           17     A.  I'm there.

           18     Q.  And you see when you were asked that question about a

           19     comparison between Bair Hugger and other devices whether or

           20     not it causes infection, you in fact cite McGovern which is

           21     in fact cited in your report, correct?

           22     A.  Correct.

           23     Q.  Let's talk about McGovern and it is Exhibit I want to

           24     say 93 but I may be wrong, it may be 94.

           25     A.  Not 94.  93.




                                                             1116



            1     Q.  93.  And you understand -- well, let me ask you.  In

            2     terms of risk of infection with the Bair Hugger used versus

            3     not having the Bair Hugger used, what was your understanding

            4     of what McGovern found?

            5     A.  Found significant difference of ratio of 3.8 to one

            6     increase infection when Bair Hugger was in use.

            7     Q.  That's in actual people who had surgery, right?

            8     A.  He looked at the medical record over I think six years

            9     and looked at the infection rate, yes.

           10     Q.  Thousands of patients?

           11     A.  1427 to be exact.

           12     Q.  Okay.  3.8 percent?

           13               MS. PRUITT:  Your Honor, I have to object.  This

           14     is --

           15               THE COURT:  Yeah, yeah.  I think anyway I'm going

           16     to -- stay here.  Members of the jury, we are going to take

           17     a -- you'll take a 20-minute recess.  And we're trying to

           18     get somebody up here from the IT department too, so

           19     hopefully everything is going to be working when you come

           20     back.  So we are excusing the jury.

           21                            (11:05 a.m.)

           22              (In open court without the jury present.)

           23               THE COURT:  All right.  You can step down, and

           24     everybody else can be seated.

           25               The objection.  Did you have an objection?




                                                             1117



            1               MS. PRUITT:  Yes, Your Honor.  Mr. Farrar then

            2     went into the substance of McGovern and was talking about

            3     increased risk and causation and that is a comparison

            4     between an alternative device and Bair Hugger that the Court

            5     has already ruled is out under MIL-1.  And I not only object

            6     but I move to strike the testimony of Dr. David where he

            7     refers to that because of the Court's previous rulings.

            8               MR. FARRAR:  Would you like a response, Your

            9     Honor?

           10               THE COURT:  Yes, please.

           11               MR. FARRAR:  One, Dr. Jarvis has already testified

           12     to this --

           13               THE COURT REPORTER:  Can you use the microphone,

           14     please?

           15               MR. FARRAR:  One, Dr. Jarvis has already testified

           16     to this issue so it's in evidence; and two, frankly, 3M

           17     kicked the door open with the questions of Mr. Davis on this

           18     exact issue when they asked him if there's a comparison

           19     between the Bair Hugger and another device specifically on

           20     infections.  That question opens the door to me talking

           21     about McGovern to Dr. David about that issue.

           22               THE COURT:  The questioning on cross was

           23     responsive to matters that were gone into on direct.  And

           24     the further questioning on the McGovern study will not be

           25     allowed.




                                                             1118



            1               MR. FARRAR:  Your Honor, I have two other points

            2     I'd like to discuss.

            3               THE COURT:  Okay.  Certainly.  I remember you said

            4     something you wanted to --

            5               MR. FARRAR:  I have three other points actually,

            6     I'm sorry.

            7               THE COURT:  Okay.  That's all right.

            8               MR. FARRAR:  Point one, I believe 3M opened the

            9     door to the FDA, so I want to get in with Dr. David the

           10     entire FDA history of --

           11               THE COURT:  Nope, that's denied.  The fact that

           12     the Tablegard was available as evidenced by the FDA

           13     approval --

           14               MR. FARRAR:  I didn't bring that in Your Honor.  I

           15     didn't mean to cut off.

           16               THE COURT:  Well, anyway, your objection is

           17     overruled.

           18               MR. FARRAR:  Okay.  Just so I can make a record,

           19     I'm going to make an offer of proof of the 510(k) process.

           20     The plaintiffs never mentioned FDA approval of the Bair

           21     Hugger or the Tablegard.  That was specifically left out

           22     pursuant to this Court's ruling; two, I believe 3M opened

           23     the door to other lawsuits when they asked Dr. David

           24     specifically, you looked at the 750 because the plaintiffs'

           25     attorneys told you it was used in this case?




                                                             1119



            1               THE COURT:  Okay.  With respect to that, there was

            2     questioning of a witness yesterday about lawsuits and there

            3     was no objection to that, but the fact that there are

            4     multiple lawsuits was already opened by questioning --

            5     question and answers yesterday under plaintiffs' counsels

            6     questioning.  So the answers that this witness gave about

            7     what he looked at and the amount of money that he has

            8     charged, it runs up against the prohibition against getting

            9     into all the other lawsuits, but I'll leave what there is

           10     there, but it does not constitute a full opening of the door

           11     on that question.

           12               MR. FARRAR:  And I appreciate it, Your Honor.  I

           13     just want to make it clear, my argument is not about the

           14     money.  It's about the fact the question was you looked at

           15     the 750 because the plaintiffs' attorneys in this case told

           16     you it was the device used in this case which is clearly

           17     inaccurate.  It leaves a misimpression to the jury about

           18     what Dr. David did.  That had to do with the MDL in general,

           19     and I think I should be able to explain that to clear up the

           20     misconception the jury has on that issue.

           21               MS. PRUITT:  Your Honor, I didn't say in this case

           22     because I was very careful not to do that.  I took that

           23     right out of the deposition and I did not say in this case

           24     when I was referring to the 750.  The jury is entitled to

           25     know that his inspection was of the 750 and that the 505 is




                                                             1120



            1     what was actually used in this case and they're entitled to

            2     consider that.

            3               THE COURT:  I do remember the general line of

            4     questioning.  I think that there was a question about the

            5     plaintiffs' lawyers showed you, I would have sustained an

            6     objection to that.  The harm in getting into the other

            7     lawsuits is, it's pretty great and it would be a big, a big

            8     -- it would be very prejudicial and it would change the way

            9     that the case has gone in.  We're then going to have a whole

           10     other trial within a trial on where the Gareis case falls

           11     vis-à-vis all the other cases.  So is that necessary?

           12               It is not made necessary by the relatively small

           13     harm, if harm there is, from the question that you're

           14     referring to, Mr. Farrar.  And we're hampered by the fact

           15     that the realtime is not working so I can't figure out

           16     the -- so I can't find the exact word, but we're looking for

           17     an exact word, we're talking about something that is not --

           18     at least in this case is not excessively prejudicial.  And

           19     so I recognize what you're saying but will not amend the

           20     order about the all the other lawsuits.

           21               MR. FARRAR:  I understood, Your Honor.  Just for

           22     the -- I understand your ruling.  Just for the record, I

           23     believe it is combination of the 750 plus all the questions

           24     about the compensation to the experts which is clearly work

           25     on an MDL and not Mr. Gareis.  And I understand, I just want




                                                             1121



            1     to make clear our position on that.

            2               MS. PRUITT:  And, Your Honor, just for the cord,

            3     for he's relying on his inspection of the 750 to give his

            4     opinion in this case that the 505 is defective.

            5               THE COURT:  All right.  Okay.  Any other issues?

            6               MR. FARRAR:  One other thing, Your Honor.  I

            7     provided the Court with the Smith v. Bruco, Inc. which is a

            8     District Court out of South Carolina from March of this

            9     year.  The cite is 2008 Westlaw 1240279.  And in the case it

           10     specifically holds at page 6 that an warning or instructions

           11     satisfies -- fulfills the burden of presenting a reasonable

           12     alternative design that satisfies the risk utility test in

           13     Branham.

           14               We are prepared to talk with Dr. David about the

           15     warnings that were on competitive products, the warnings

           16     that were on prior models of the Bair Hugger, and the

           17     warning that is not -- the warning instructions that are not

           18     on the Bair Hugger 550, and we believe that that safer

           19     alternative design the jury should hear about, and that is

           20     in Dr. David's report.

           21               THE COURT:  Any response?

           22               MR. HULSE:  Yes, Your Honor.  That's -- come right

           23     back with Fisher v. Pelstring out of the District of South

           24     Carolina, 817 F.Supp.2d 791, 818 which specifically held

           25     that you cannot demonstrate an alterative feasible design




                                                             1122



            1     through a warning, an additional warning.  It's right on

            2     point, and nothing in the Smith case that Mr. Farrar just

            3     cited is counter to it.

            4               THE COURT:  Well, do you have a date on the 817

            5     F.Supp.2d 791 case?

            6               MR. HULSE:  That is a 2018 case.

            7               THE COURT:  It is 2018, okay.  I --

            8               MR. HULSE:  We don't believe it actually -- that's

            9     what it stands, Your Honor, but Your Honor can read it

           10     yourself.

           11               THE COURT:  Well, I have read.  I did have a

           12     chance to read while I was also listening to the testimony

           13     the case that was given to me by Mr. Farrar during one of

           14     the bench recesses.  And it's a summary judgment order, and

           15     summary judgment is granted in part and it was denied on the

           16     design defect claim.

           17               One of the design defects there had to do with

           18     whether warnings and training went along with this saw about

           19     warnings about what to do if a piece of wood got stuck in

           20     the saw.  I might not be getting this right because I just

           21     read it.  But the warnings weren't as would be here do not

           22     use this device in this kind of situation.  The warnings

           23     would have enabled a user to use the product for the purpose

           24     that it was intended.  And so would not have been a

           25     completely different -- it would -- it's a warning not to




                                                             1123



            1     use it.  It's a warning about when you use it, here's what

            2     you do when the piece of wood gets stuck.  I assume that

            3     warning would be like something like don't stick your hand

            4     in there.

            5               It was interesting that that theory of alternative

            6     design doesn't seem to have been presented by the -- I don't

            7     know if this Dureg, he must have been a plaintiff's expert

            8     because the alternative designs that the counsel seemed to

            9     have been relying on were the ones that are listed on the

           10     previous page, barrier guards and a guard installed and a

           11     motor breaking system and so on.

           12               And then there's apparently there was a deposition

           13     or an affidavit or something, testimony from a somebody

           14     named Dearmond about this, the way they did the warnings.

           15     It seems hard to believe that they would just give a warning

           16     about a saw if people asked for it, but anyway, that's what

           17     I'm getting from this.

           18               So it is from the point of view of applying the

           19     Branham case, not -- I don't think this stands for the

           20     proposition that a reasonable alternative device can consist

           21     of a warning not to use the product at all.  So that's how I

           22     -- that's how I read this Smith case.  I have no idea what

           23     this other case is.  I can't remember the name of it,

           24     Mr. Hulse.  This 817 F. Supp case, but that's the --

           25               MR. HULSE:  Fisher v. Pelstring.  The one I gave




                                                             1124



            1     you, Your Honor.

            2               THE COURT:  Okay.

            3               MR. FARRAR:  Your Honor, if I could just make for

            4     the record the warning that we say doesn't say don't use it.

            5     The warning that was --

            6               THE COURT:  In orthopedic surgery.

            7               MR. FARRAR:  It doesn't say don't use it.  It

            8     says, let me not misquote it.  But the warning on the old

            9     device says the possibility of airborne contamination should

           10     be considered.  And the Mistral warning says something along

           11     that line.  So, actually, I have it right here.

           12               This Mistral was on the market, the consumer

           13     product, and the warning says the Mistral air plus warming

           14     unit is fitted with an air filter.  However, airborne

           15     contamination should be taken into consideration when using

           16     the warming system.  So it's not an issue where it says

           17     don't use it as I think the Court may be inclined to think

           18     that was our evidence.  It is really a warning that, hey,

           19     this causes airborne contamination or could, and you need to

           20     be cognizant of that when using it.

           21               THE COURT:  Isn't that what we covered in one of

           22     the pretrial orders though about what was available to 3M at

           23     the relevant time back in -- at the time of the Gareis

           24     surgery?

           25               MR. FARRAR:  We did, Your Honor, and the evidence,




                                                             1125



            1     and I think it's interesting in the Smith case that the

            2     warnings was abandoned, so the Court didn't rule on the

            3     warnings issue in the Smith case that I've cited to you.

            4     You can look at the footnote, and it says that the failure

            5     to warn is abandoned at the hearing.

            6               THE COURT:  Wait a second.  I thought they --

            7               MR. FARRAR:  The warnings go directly to design

            8     defect only and safer alternative design.

            9               THE COURT:  Right, but that's all you're talking

           10     about warning.  Summary judgment was granted on the other

           11     warnings.

           12               MR. FARRAR:  It was.  So and the issue about when

           13     and what they knew, the point I want to make to the jury as

           14     the prior devices had the warnings, so clearly the

           15     information was at 3M, they were warning before this device

           16     was ever created.

           17               THE COURT:  Oh, yeah, okay.  All right.  Do you

           18     want to continue making your record or do you think you've

           19     done it now?

           20               MR. FARRAR:  No, I think I have.  And, Your Honor,

           21     I guess the last sort of housekeeping question is I've

           22     typically made these offers of proof with the witness on the

           23     stand and without the jury.  I understand that is sort of

           24     time consuming.  But I don't know how the Court wants me to

           25     do this.  I don't think I've made my offer of proof yet.




                                                             1126



            1     I've argued the point, and I understand the ruling, but to

            2     talk about the evidence and what he's going to say, I just

            3     need some guidance in how you want me to do that.

            4               THE COURT:  Well, we have his report, and you have

            5     his deposition testimony.  So you can just tell me what he

            6     would say.

            7               MR. FARRAR:  And I'm happy to do that.  Do you

            8     want to do it right now?

            9               THE COURT:  Do it right now.

           10               MR. FARRAR:  I'm going to make a few, with the

           11     Court's indulgence I just need my --

           12               On the safer alternative design for warning, we

           13     would admit or offer Exhibits 351, which is the prior models

           14     with the warning; 738, which is a prior model with the

           15     warning; and 382, which is a competitor's device with the

           16     warning.  That was available at the time, and Dr. David

           17     would say a way to make a product less defective or less

           18     dangerous without changing or altering a device is to

           19     include adequate warnings or instructions.

           20               We believe that those exhibits are adequate

           21     warnings and instructions that should have been given to

           22     anesthesiologists and physicians and hospital personnel, and

           23     that that would have made a device a safer alternative

           24     design.

           25               I would like to do an offer of proof on we talked




                                                             1127



            1     about the Court's excluded dirty machines or reservoirs of

            2     infection.  Dr. David would say that the device harboring

            3     bacteria and blowing them on the patient is unreasonably

            4     dangerous.  And he would add Exhibits 177, 178, 295, 358,

            5     769, 52, and 539.

            6               Finally, Dr. David would discuss basically

            7     electric blankets or other warming devices that aren't

            8     forced air warming, conductive blankets.  And VitaHEAT would

            9     be a specific one he would testify to is a safer alternative

           10     design.  And we would admit Exhibits 1305, 1167 on that

           11     issue.

           12               Finally, Your Honor, I wasn't necessarily prepared

           13     for this.  This may be a little bit more cumbersome, but he

           14     would testify that the device originally, the Bair Hugger

           15     device 200 was intended for not in the operating room.  The

           16     500 came on later and it was not in the operating room.  And

           17     the 505 is the first one put in the operating room and that

           18     adequate notice was not given to the FDA on the issue.  He

           19     would testify that the FDA 510(k) process is not an

           20     assurance of safety but rather just a reasonable equivalence

           21     to an old device.

           22               He would testify about the old device being the

           23     Sweetland Bed Warmer, and how it's a completely different

           24     device and function in operation to the Bair Hugger.  We

           25     would admit exhibits, this may take me a second, Exhibit 2,




                                                             1128



            1     I know, which is the original 510(k) for the device.  And

            2     Dr. David would discuss in Exhibit 2 how it was created for

            3     use outside of the operating room after surgery to keep

            4     patients warm.

            5               We would admit Exhibit 642, which is an FDA

            6     flowchart on the clearance of the 505 device showing that

            7     the FDA did no safety analysis because, frankly, the person

            8     doing the review checked the wrong box.  Dr. David would

            9     discuss how that mistake prevented the FDA from doing any

           10     safety analysis whatsoever on the 505 device.

           11               We would admit Exhibit 47, which is the 510(k) for

           12     the 505.

           13               We would admit Exhibit 639, which is an IOM

           14     report, which discusses how the FDA does not have the man

           15     power or facilities to adequately test devices.  And

           16     Dr. David having been on the advisory panel for the FDA for

           17     I don't know how many years, for a long time, would discuss

           18     the meaning of that and the importance of that and how this

           19     device has never been tested.  How clearance through the FDA

           20     510(k) process is not an assurance of safety, and

           21     Exhibit 639 would help him with that discussion.

           22               We would introduce Exhibit 1150.  I may have said

           23     this one but 642, as well as the deposition testimony of

           24     3M's expert Dr. Ulatowski, who agreed on the flowchart that

           25     the FDA examiner made a mistake and that mistake led to the




                                                             1129



            1     FDA not analyzing the safety issues of putting a Bair Hugger

            2     into the operating room and used intraoperatively.  And that

            3     concludes it.  Thank you, Your Honor.

            4               THE COURT:  All right.  Mr. Farrar, how long of

            5     break do you need?

            6               MR. FARRAR:  If you could give me ten minutes or

            7     even five is fine, but just a second to kind of get my

            8     thoughts back together, I would appreciate it.

            9               THE COURT:  And here comes something from

           10     Ms. Zimmerman.

           11               MS. ZIMMERMAN:  Yes, I have courtesy copies of the

           12     filings that went in this morning.

           13               THE COURT:  Oh, thank you very much.  Can you

           14     imagine what I encountered when I walked into my chambers

           15     this morning?

           16               MS. ZIMMERMAN:  It crashed our printer as well.

           17               THE COURT:  Thank you.  That's great.  I really

           18     appreciate it.

           19               MR. FARRAR:  Your Honor?  And --

           20               THE COURT:  Are we still on the record?  I'm

           21     asking Mr. Farrar.

           22               MR. FARRAR:  I just want clarification.  McGovern

           23     is out.  I can't talk about McGovern?

           24               THE COURT:  Correct.

           25               MR. FARRAR:  Okay, I just wanted to make sure.




                                                             1130



            1               THE COURT:  We've done all of the McGovern we're

            2     going to do.

            3               MS. PRUITT:  Your Honor, I would ask the Court to

            4     strike the questions about McGovern and the responses, and I

            5     don't know if the Court grants that, I don't know how Her

            6     Honor wants to handle it, but I would move it.

            7               THE COURT:  I'm not going to strike it, but that

            8     -- and I know you don't have the real time right now, but if

            9     you can put in a written request a motion to strike, I know

           10     what you're talking about but just to be specific because

           11     I'm going to take another look at it, but I would really

           12     like to have the specifics, and then the issue is going to

           13     be whether it could be talked about in closing argument or

           14     not.

           15               But to strike it now versus striking it later, you

           16     know it's not contemporaneous, any effect on the jury is --

           17     well, what am I trying to say?  It's one thing to try and

           18     strike them -- strike something that they just heard a

           19     moment ago, but we're already a moment past that, so now I

           20     would rather get it in writing and have a chance to think

           21     about it and look at it and give the plaintiffs a chance to

           22     respond, if they have any response.

           23               MS. PRUITT:  Thank you, Your Honor.

           24               THE COURT:  Okay.  Ten minutes we're in recess.

           25                            (Recess at 11:27 a.m.)




                                                             1131

            2              (In open court without the jury present.)

            3               THE COURT:  We're here outside the hearing of the

            4     jury.  It occurs to me that some clarity on the uses of the

            5     McGovern study, whether it pertains to this particular

            6     witness or not, would be helpful.

            7               It is not the Court's ruling that McGovern in its

            8     totality is inadmissible.  I've ruled that the HotDog can't

            9     be used as a reasonable alternative device; but if there's

           10     anything useful on this theory of causation that can be

           11     gleaned from McGovern in the plaintiff's opinion, go ahead

           12     and use it for that purpose.

           13               So I think that that might be the cause of some of

           14     the uncertainty or confusion, so there.  So now we're going

           15     to bring the jury in.

           16               I've been told that everything is working now.  Is

           17     the realtime working for you?

           18               MR. HULSE:  Yes, it is.  Full working order.

           19               THE COURT:  Say what?

           20               MR. HULSE:  Full working order.

           21               THE COURT:  Full working order, he says.  That's a

           22     big statement.

           23               How about your microphone?  Is that working?

           24               THE WITNESS:  One, two, three, test.  Yes.

            5               MR. FARRAR:  Thank you.

            6     BY MR. FARRAR:

            7     Q.  Dr. David, before we left, or I guess when we left off,

            8     we were discussing the Tablegard.  And I want to show you a

            9     document that you were shown on cross by Ms. Pruitt.  In

           10     your work you deal with patents from time to time on medical

           11     devices?

           12     A.  Absolutely, yes.

           13     Q.  And you were shown this, but let me ask you, Are all

           14     medical devices patented?

           15     A.  No, of course not.

           16     Q.  Can a medical device be on the market for some length of

           17     time and then be patented later on?

           18     A.  Absolutely.

           19     Q.  You were shown this as the date of the patent is 2014,

           20     but can you tell when the patent was filed?

           21     A.  I didn't see the document before, but as you can see on

           22     line 22 it has a filing date of March 4, 2009.

           23     Q.  So the technology -- or let me ask you another way.

           24     Does that prove to you that the technology existed in 2009?

           25     A.  Yes.

            1     Q.  Does this document in any way tell the ladies and

            2     gentlemen of the jury when the device was on the market?

            3     A.  No.

            4     Q.  That would not be the whole truth?

            5     A.  Correct.

            6     Q.  If you look at Exhibit 1379 in your book.

            7     A.  I'm there.

            8     Q.  Does that document give you the whole truth as to when

            9     the Tablegard was on the market?

           10     A.  That does.

           11     Q.  What's the date?

           12     A.  May 30th, 2008.

           13     Q.  You were asked questions about your inspection of the

           14     750, not the 505.  Do you recall that?

           15     A.  I do.

           16     Q.  Does it -- from your engineering opinion, what are the

           17     differences between the 505 and the 750?

           18     A.  Not very specific and limited differences between the

           19     two instruments.  These are family of the same principal

           20     product with evolution improving over time.  The specific

           21     differences between the two is the size of the filter and

           22     the monitoring of the temperature and the flow rates.  And

           23     that's to summarize it.

           24     Q.  In terms of your opinion, is the 505 just as defective

           25     as the 750?




                                                             1134



            1     A.  Yeah, this is, this is blowing forced warm air around

            2     surgical field causing turbulences and picking up nonsterile

            3     particles into the sterile field.  It's not --

            4               MS. PRUITT:  Objection, Your Honor.

            5               THE COURT:  Hold on.  Hold on.

            6               MS. PRUITT:  MIL2.  Move to strike.

            7               THE COURT:  Go ahead and finish your answer.

            8               THE WITNESS:  It's obviously not safe.

            9               THE COURT:  All right.  Next question, or are you

           10     done?

           11               MR. FARRAR:  No, Your Honor.  I thought -- I'm

           12     sorry.  It was my fault.

           13     BY MR. FARRAR:

           14     Q.  You were asked some questions about page 15 specifically

           15     of your report in your examination of the 750.

           16     A.  I'm there.

           17     Q.  And you were asked questions about the temperature being

           18     36 degrees coming out of the blanket.  Do you recall that?

           19     A.  Yes.

           20     Q.  If you would, would you back up a couple sentences and

           21     say through -- there's a sentence that begins "Through the

           22     test."  Would you read that for me?

           23     A.  It's the previous sentence to the one that was discussed

           24     earlier and it goes, "Through the test I found that this

           25     used exemplar unit did not appear to be performing normally,




                                                             1135



            1     as the blanket temperature deferred significantly from

            2     internal documentations."

            3     Q.  36 degrees is about how -- is about what temperature

            4     Fahrenheit?

            5     A.  I think we talked about 96.8, but basically it's the

            6     body temperature.

            7     Q.  If 36 degrees was being blown on a person, would that

            8     warm them?

            9     A.  Not unless they came from the cold.

           10     Q.  In other words, the 750 you looked at, the heating

           11     element wasn't working, right?

           12     A.  Not working properly, yes.

           13     Q.  It was defective?

           14     A.  It was defective, and it so stated.

           15     Q.  You were asked a question about something in your

           16     deposition on page 202.  Do you still have your deposition

           17     up there?  And the question related to whether or not you

           18     believe it's important to keep a patient warm.  And there's

           19     a long answer, and you didn't get to read it all, and I

           20     don't want you to read it all, but you've read it since that

           21     time, correct?

           22     A.  Correct.

           23     Q.  And tell me, what type of patient warming were you

           24     discussing in your answer.

           25     A.  As the paragraph continues in my deposition document




                                                             1136



            1     here, it is talking about the patients who are in specific

            2     condition like pediatrics, that is very difficult for child

            3     to keep the body temperature on its own, neonatal, newborns,

            4     in the emergency room and environment, and nothing to do

            5     with surgery.

            6     Q.  Not intraoperatively; is that fair?

            7     A.  That's correct, not intraoperatively.

            8     Q.  Do you have an opinion one way or the other whether

            9     keeping a patient warm in a one- to two-hour orthopedic

           10     surgery has a benefit?

           11     A.  I would defer your question to the clinicians, to the

           12     experts.

           13     Q.  What was your job in this case?

           14     A.  My job as my profession, I'm a biomedical engineer.  I

           15     am expert in medical devices and how to safely use them.  So

           16     my job was to analyze the hazardous condition, if it exists,

           17     of the Bair Hugger devices during orthopedic procedures.

           18     Q.  Was your job to say if a surgeon wants to warm a

           19     patient, are there better ways?

           20     A.  Sure.  That's the whole concept of finding a safer

           21     alternative design.

           22     Q.  When you do your hazard analysis, do you test in a

           23     medical device in every OR across the United States to make

           24     sure it's safe in every OR?

           25     A.  I just read an article, on flying up here, that there




                                                             1137



            1     400 million surgery a year.  It's impossible to visit all

            2     the operating room and do these tests.  You will start with

            3     a device; you will never get to the second one.  It's

            4     impossible to do that.

            5     Q.  So you were asked questions about did you go visit

            6     Operating Room 4 or review Mr. Gareis's medical records.

            7     Was that important in your hazard device analysis?

            8     A.  I -- that's not my purpose.  I did not serve as an

            9     individual who is looking at particular room number and

           10     procedure, but much more about the category of principle of

           11     heating patient during orthopedic surgery, regardless where

           12     it is, and how can you mitigate and eliminate the risk.

           13     Q.  Finally, doctor, you were asked some questions about

           14     whether the device is on the floor or on an IV clamp six to

           15     eight inches in the air.  Do you recall that?

           16     A.  I do.

           17     Q.  If the device is clamped six to eight inches off the

           18     ground, is it still pulling in air from the nonsterile

           19     field?

           20     A.  Absolutely, yes.  It's below the surgical table.

           21     Everything on the operating floor and below the table is

           22     nonsterile.

           23               MR. FARRAR:  No more questions.

           24               THE COURT:  Thank you, Mr. Farrar.

           25               MS. PRUITT:  Your Honor, I just have one, if I




                                                                             1138



            1     might be allowed.

            2               THE COURT:  All right.  Go ahead.

            3               MS. PRUITT:  Famous last words,

            4                         RECROSS-EXAMINATION

            5     BY MS. PRUITT:

            6     Q.  Dr. David, you examined a device in this case to give

            7     your opinions to this jury that you just said did not appear

            8     to be functioning normally, correct?

            9     A.  Let me --

           10     Q.  Is that correct, sir?

           11     A.  You want me to answer a question I don't understand or

           12     you want me to help with --

           13     Q.  I heard your testimony and I wrote it down.  You told

           14     the jury you examined a device in this case, the 750, that

           15     did not appear to be functioning normally, correct?

           16     A.  Excuse me, counsel.  I do not understand the question.

           17     Can you --

           18     Q.  That's all I have.

           19               MS. PRUITT:  Thank you, Your Honor.

           20               THE COURT:  All right.  You may step down.

           21               Call your next witness.  Ms. Zimmerman.

           22               MS. ZIMMERMAN:  Thank you, Your Honor.

           23               Pardon me.  There was one additional piece of

           24     housekeeping I wanted to add.  Yesterday I promised to get

           25     you the exhibit number for the article that I referenced in




                                                                             1139



            1     the redirect.

            2               THE COURT:  Yes, thank you.

            3               MS. ZIMMERMAN:  And that was Plaintiff's

            4     Exhibit 1178.

            5               THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.

            6               MS. ZIMMERMAN:  Thank you.  And at this time we

            7     call Mr. Louis Gareis.

            8                            LOUIS GAREIS,

            9     called on behalf of himself, was duly sworn, was examined

           10     and testified as follows:

           11               THE COURT:  You know what to do.  Take the witness

           12     stand.  State your name, spell your last for the record.

           13               THE WITNESS:  My name is Louis Calvin Gareis, Jr.

           14     G-a-r-e-i-s.

           15               THE COURT:  All right, Ms. Zimmerman.

           16                          DIRECT EXAMINATION

           17     BY MS. ZIMMERMAN:

           18     Q.  Thank you, Mr. Gareis, and thank you for sitting

           19     patiently through this trial.  Could you take a moment and

           20     introduce yourself to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury?

           21     A.  Well, it's nice to meet you.  You finally get a chance

           22     to put a face or a body to the name of Gareis.  Right?  I've

           23     been listening to my name a hundred times I think in the

           24     last week and it's all pronounced different each time, so

           25     I'll accept anything.




                                                                             1140



            1     Q.  Well, I apologize if I've mispronounced it.  Where do

            2     you live right now?

            3     A.  South Carolina.

            4     Q.  All right.  And have you lived there for a long time?

            5     A.  25 years.

            6     Q.  And where did you live before that?

            7     A.  New Jersey.

            8     Q.  And you're married?

            9     A.  Yes.

           10     Q.  When did you get married?

           11     A.  '73.

           12     Q.  And the lucky lady has been sitting next to you during

           13     the trial?

           14     A.  Yes, ma'am.

           15     Q.  And what's her name?

           16     A.  Lillian.

           17     Q.  And do you have any children together?

           18     A.  One.

           19     Q.  What's her name?

           20     A.  Darlene.

           21     Q.  Do you have any grandkids?

           22     A.  I should say Darlene Trusdell, because she's married

           23     now.  Grandkids?  Sure.  I've got eleven.

           24     Q.  Eleven grand kids.  And how about any great grandkids?

           25     A.  Four.  No.  Five.  I'm sorry.  We just had another one




                                                                             1141



            1     here recently.

            2     Q.  Congratulations.  And I understand you're retired?

            3     A.  Yes, I am.

            4     Q.  How long have you been retired?

            5     A.  Well, if you consider when I gave up my business that I

            6     had, it's been about four or five years.

            7     Q.  All right.  What did you do for work before you moved to

            8     South Carolina?

            9     A.  Well, I worked for Dupont for 30 years, and I got

           10     retirement, early retirement from Dupont.  They were

           11     downsizing our plant, and I lucked out.  I was in the right

           12     place at the right time.  I was 50 years old.  They gave me

           13     full retirement, what I would have got at 65, and they

           14     supplemented my social security and said goodbye, and I

           15     left.

           16     Q.  All right.

           17     A.  And I went to South Carolina because my daughter was

           18     pitching for the University of South Carolina.  She got a

           19     full-ride scholarship there.

           20     Q.  All right.  And what -- tell me about your life when you

           21     moved to South Carolina.  What were you doing down there?

           22     A.  Well, when I first got down there, I was looking for

           23     something to supplement my income, so I started substitute

           24     teaching and licensed in District 2.  I did that for about

           25     five years.  And then I started, when me and my daughter got




                                                                             1142



            1     there, I went to one of her first games.  It was Furman

            2     against University of South Carolina.  She was a softball

            3     pitcher.  And there was one girl from South Carolina on the

            4     team, on South Carolina's team, one girl from Furman on

            5     South Carolina's team.  So I said why is that, all these

            6     girls from the northeast?

            7     Q.  From different parts of the country?

            8     A.  Midwest.  Yes.  And we checked into it, and the rec

            9     departments in South Carolina, Georgia and North Carolina

           10     did not allow fast pitch.  They were all slow pitch.  So the

           11     girls didn't have a feeder system up into high school, which

           12     was fast pitch and the colleges were all fast pitch.

           13     Q.  So did you get involved with softball then in South

           14     Carolina?

           15     A.  Yes, we started teaching.

           16     Q.  Who did you teach?

           17     A.  We went around to the different -- we had clinics at the

           18     different high schools, rec departments, out at the fields,

           19     and we had a big response for learning to fast pitch.  So I

           20     kind of lucked out again; there was nobody down there

           21     teaching it, except me.  So we had girls flocking to our

           22     clinics.  And our goal was to get the girls from South

           23     Carolina to compete for the scholarships at the local

           24     colleges, because those scholarships are mostly full-ride

           25     scholarships for the pitchers.




                                                                             1143



            1     Q.  And were you successful in that?

            2     A.  Well, we had approximately 150 girls get scholarships

            3     all over the southeast.

            4     Q.  All right.  And is softball something you enjoyed?

            5     A.  Love it.  I played, I played it when I worked for

            6     Dupont.  We had leagues.  And I played it for -- gosh, how

            7     many years?  40 years probably I played softball.

            8     Q.  Can you estimate for the ladies and gentlemen of the

            9     jury about how much of your time once you moved to South

           10     Carolina was devoted to softball?

           11     A.  Well, once our clinics got going and all the girls

           12     started coming to our clinics, we set up a pitching clinic,

           13     permanent pitching clinic, inside a building.  So the girls

           14     came from North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia to our

           15     clinic, and we had five pitchers pitching at a time.  And my

           16     daughter helped me some because she had a lot of credibility

           17     being a pitcher and pitching for University of South

           18     Carolina.  And, gosh, over, over the period of maybe

           19     20 years we, we had thousands, I'd say 2500 girls, come

           20     through our system.  And usually there's only one out of ten

           21     that would get a scholarship, but it helped these girls to

           22     pitch in rec leagues and for the high schools, and a very

           23     few of them, a small percentage of them, actually got

           24     scholarships, which ended up being 150 girls at the

           25     colleges.  My time was Monday through Friday and then most




                                                                             1144



            1     of the time all day Saturday.

            2     Q.  Fair to say something you enjoyed?

            3     A.  Yes, I really enjoyed it.  I didn't make a lot of money,

            4     because I had to hold down the costs because the kids

            5     couldn't afford it down there, so the cost covered the

            6     expense, basically, most of the time.

            7     Q.  All right.

            8     A.  And I did it -- adjusted it a little bit up and down,

            9     but I was paying a lot of money for the building, $1500 for

           10     the building a month, plus $800 for electric for the air

           11     conditioning.  Remember, we're in South Carolina.

           12     Insurance, big, big deal, $100 a month insurance, right.

           13     Q.  So the ladies and gentlemen of the jury have been

           14     hearing testimony now for the last week and a half or so

           15     that you suffered from a deep joint infection after your hip

           16     replacement; is that right?

           17     A.  After my second.  My first one went great.  The second

           18     one got infected, unfortunately.

           19     Q.  So that's a good point.  You had your other hip done?

           20     Is that the left side?

           21     A.  I had the left side done, same doctor, and it worked.

           22     It was perfect.  I wondered why I took so long to wait to

           23     get it, you know.  That's why I was in such a hurry.

           24     Because I played football in high school, I think that added

           25     something to do with it, talking to the doctors.  I was an




                                                                             1145



            1     offensive lineman and a linebacker, and it's really hard on

            2     your legs and your joints and I -- what was the question?  I

            3     got off it back to the football, which is another one of my

            4     loves, when I played football in high school.

            5     Q.  So let's stay on your left hip for just a minute.

            6     A.  Okay.

            7     Q.  That took place in 2009 or so; is that right?

            8     A.  2009, right.

            9     Q.  Did you get back to coaching after that?

           10     A.  Yes.

           11     Q.  And then you went to have your right hip done in

           12     November of 2010, is that right?

           13     A.  Correct.

           14     Q.  And how did you do after surgery?

           15     A.  Well, at first I did the same as my left.  I literally

           16     went from a walker to a cane, and a period of time where I

           17     thought maybe it was going to be okay, even though I did

           18     have a little bit of pain, back to a cane, and I thought

           19     what is going on, and then back to a walker.  And then in

           20     the meantime I went back to the doctor naturally off and on

           21     trying to figure out what was matter with me, what was going

           22     on, but first we thought it might be my back.

           23     Q.  Mr. Gareis, did you follow the instructions that you got

           24     from Dr. Presnal after your surgery?

           25     A.  Yes.




                                                                             1146



            1     Q.  And there came a time where you started to have some

            2     changes on the other side; is that right?

            3     A.  Correct.

            4     Q.  Do you remember when about that was?

            5     A.  It was about three to four months, I would say, after my

            6     initial surgery that I started having pretty good pain.

            7     Before that, it was slight, and that's when I went back to a

            8     cane and back to a walker.  And my wife was helping me,

            9     driving me to the doctors, and I was going to the doctors

           10     with a walker.

           11     Q.  And when you said "pretty good pain," I'm assuming you

           12     mean significant pain?

           13     A.  I mean you can't sleep.  You can't lay on that side.  I

           14     still can't lay on that side for a long time, but the pain

           15     was excruciating.  I don't know how to explain it, but, I

           16     mean, you can't live with that pain very long.  Something

           17     had to be done.

           18     Q.  All right.  And you were eventually diagnosed with an

           19     infection?

           20     A.  That's correct.

           21     Q.  Do you remember about when that happened?

           22     A.  Oh, let me see.  It must have been, it was months after

           23     I actually had the initial pain.  I can explain a little

           24     bit.  We went to other options first, was it your back

           25     because the pain was so severe I couldn't tell if it was




                                                                             1147



            1     coming from my back or my hip.  And I had had some back

            2     surgery years before and we thought, well, maybe that's

            3     coming back.  As it turned out, it wasn't my back.  We

            4     didn't diagnose it until long time after I actually went

            5     back for the first time is when we got a sample, they took a

            6     sample of my hip with a needle and it came back that it was

            7     an infection.  That's when they actually diagnosed it, but I

            8     actually started long before that.  That was kind of like

            9     the last thing they tried.

           10     Q.  Okay.  And you needed another surgery at some point; is

           11     that right?

           12     A.  Well, it was either that, yes, I definitely needed

           13     another surgery.  Dr. Presnal, who I love, I think he saved

           14     my life, definitely need another surgery and that's what he

           15     told me.  I had no other options.  There was no way to

           16     cure -- there was no way to kill the germs inside the --

           17     what they put in without taking it out.  The option was

           18     taking it out, put a temporary one in, and then put, after

           19     you're cured and after they come back with a test that you

           20     don't have any infection anymore, then they take that out

           21     and put another one in.  So I had three surgeries on my

           22     right hip.

           23     Q.  So what was that first surgery like in August of 2011?

           24     A.  Are you talking about the one where they put the

           25     temporary hip in?




                                                                             1148



            1     Q.  Yes, sir.

            2     A.  Right?  What was it like?  Actually, it wasn't any

            3     different than the other two, except when I -- it kind of --

            4     my pain was gone pretty fast afterwards.  Now, I don't want

            5     to get the surgeries mixed up now.  The first one was on my

            6     left hip, right.

            7     Q.  Yes.

            8     A.  The second one was on my right hip.

            9     Q.  Yes.

           10     A.  This is the third one you're talking about.

           11     Q.  You're tracking perfectly, sir.

           12     A.  When you have so many surgeries, sometimes you get

           13     confused, you know.

           14     Q.  Okay.  Well, we'll try and keep each other on track.  Do

           15     you know about how long you were in the hospital?

           16     A.  I don't think I was in a hospital that long for any of

           17     them really.  They try to get you out of the hospital today

           18     as quick as they can.

           19     Q.  A couple of days or so?

           20     A.  Yeah, something like that.

           21     Q.  All right.  And you said that you started with a walker;

           22     is that right?

           23     A.  Well, in all of them you start with a walker because you

           24     can't put -- you can hardly put any weight on that leg and

           25     you have to use a Walker to get around the house.  I




                                                                             1149



            1     actually put, in the bathroom, I actually put some handles

            2     on the shower so I wouldn't fall.  Hard to take showers, you

            3     know.

            4     Q.  And at some point you started using a cane it sounds

            5     like?

            6     A.  Then I went to a cane.  That's the same scenario for all

            7     of them.

            8     Q.  When you left the hospital did you have any kind of

            9     antibiotics?  In August of 2011 I should say.

           10     A.  Okay.  Third surgery?

           11     Q.  Yes.

           12     A.  They give you antibiotics before and after I think every

           13     surgery, but are you talking about at home?

           14     Q.  Yes, sir.

           15     A.  My wife had to give me IVs for six weeks and -- six or

           16     seven weeks she gave me an IV.  They put a picc, there's

           17     another word for it, but I just call it a picc.

           18     Q.  A picc line?

           19     A.  Yeah, on your arm, up near your heart or in your heart

           20     or close to it, in that artery, and that's -- through that

           21     line they give you -- they give you your IV.  The IV came,

           22     looked like a balloon, had pressure on it, and my wife had

           23     to give it to me twice day for seven weeks, I think.

           24     Q.  All right.

           25     A.  If I'm not mistaken.




                                                                             1150



            1     Q.  And did you have to -- did you have follow-up

            2     appointments with your doctors like Dr. Presnal then?

            3     A.  Yes, and I had to go to the Lexington Medical Center

            4     twice a week to get blood work done, so I had to use my

            5     walker and stuff to get in there, way down at the other end

            6     of the hospital from the door I went in, so they finally

            7     started to give me a wheelchair, they finally took me down

            8     there, but I had to go down there for, goodness gracious,

            9     eight, ten weeks after my surgery to make sure that the

           10     antibiotics were working that my wife was giving me.  She

           11     was instructed by the nurses that came to the house how to

           12     do it.  And it was -- and it wasn't easy.

           13     Q.  All right.  And did those lab appointments, did those

           14     last through, what, about Thanksgiving or Christmas or

           15     something like that?

           16     A.  Something like that.  It lasted until they found that I

           17     didn't have any more infection.  A couple times my -- at

           18     least once my infection went up and the results, which

           19     really scared me, when you think you're going to die, and I

           20     actually thought I was going to die, so did my wife, and

           21     it's very taxing on you, you know.  One surgery is bad

           22     enough.  Three surgeries on one side, I can't explain how

           23     bad it is.

           24     Q.  All right.  And at some point you needed to have a third

           25     surgery then on that side, so it was your fourth surgery




                                                                             1151



            1     altogether, right?

            2     A.  Fourth surgery altogether, correct.

            3     Q.  Do you remember at all about when that happened?

            4     A.  The last surgery was 2-12, I mean 2012.

            5     Q.  Okay.

            6     A.  The last surgery was, yeah, 2012, and after that

            7     surgery, I did pretty good, except I never got full use of

            8     my right leg or my right hip.

            9     Q.  And does that continue today?

           10     A.  Yes.  I threw away my cane about two months ago because

           11     I thought it was acting as a crutch.  I wanted to start

           12     walking without a cane.  I came in here without a cane.  I

           13     did it on purpose.  I threw that cane away because I wanted

           14     to try to improve my walking without the cane, and it

           15     worked.

           16     Q.  All right.  Have you gotten back to the softball

           17     coaching that you did?

           18     A.  Well, I couldn't do anything, those three surgeries that

           19     I had, especially the one where they put after the

           20     infection, I couldn't go up to the academy, we call it a

           21     pitching academy, so my daughter kind of pinch hit for me

           22     and went in there and tried to keep the business going.

           23     It's funny but the teenage girls wanted me and the college

           24     girls wanted me, the younger girls wanted my -- was okay

           25     with my daughter.  That's just the way it works for some




                                                                             1152



            1     reason, and I don't know why.  But because I wasn't going in

            2     there, she did the best she could to keep them going, but

            3     they started dropping off one after the other because I

            4     wasn't in there as much as I should have been, and when I

            5     did go in there, I was on a cane and I couldn't demonstrate

            6     like I used to.  And it was tough for me because a lot of

            7     these girls that I was teaching were poor girls, they were

            8     from poor areas.  And they -- they didn't have the money,

            9     their parents didn't have the money, and I tried to keep the

           10     prices down, and my competitors were charging twice what I

           11     was charging.  I say competitors, I was the only one doing

           12     it for a long time and then all of a sudden all these other

           13     people seen me having a little bit of success, they started

           14     doing it.

           15     Q.  Did there come to be a time where you had to close the

           16     business?

           17     A.  Yes, 2013.

           18     Q.  All right.  Now, the jury had an opportunity to hear a

           19     little bit from your wife about the impact that this has had

           20     on her, and I know that this is difficult to talk about, but

           21     has this medical care that you've required in your

           22     infection, has it had an impact on your intimate

           23     relationship with your wife?

           24     A.  I would say definitely.

           25     Q.  And is that a part of your relationship that you enjoyed




                                                                             1153



            1     prior to the surgery?

            2     A.  Of course.  My wife was a very loving person and we

            3     enjoyed it.  It affected me because I played football, I

            4     worked, I worked as a pipe fitter at Bethlehem for a long

            5     time -- I mean at DuPont for a long time.  I actually worked

            6     at Baltimore before I moved to New Jersey.  I was born in

            7     Baltimore, by the way, Baltimore, Maryland, I worked at

            8     Bethlehem Steel Company which is a macho job.  I worked on

            9     the open hearth furnaces, so I went for football, open

           10     hearth furnaces, pipe fitter, and then worked my way up

           11     salary at DuPont after 30 years.  But as a macho man, if you

           12     think that you can't satisfy your wife for some reason, it

           13     really, it really hits you hard.

           14     Q.  So did you -- when did you come to know that the Bair

           15     Hugger was used during your surgery?  Did you know it during

           16     your surgery?

           17     A.  No, I didn't know it until long after my surgeries were

           18     over.

           19     Q.  All right.  And how did you come to learn about that?

           20     A.  I saw an ad on TV along about '15 -- 2015 or '16 and

           21     first time I saw it, you know, I thought, well, that sounds

           22     like me, but then I thought, nah.  And then I saw it a

           23     couple more times and I got my wife out to look at it, and

           24     we decided we'll give a call to the number on there.

           25     Q.  All right.  And so did you learn about a Bair Hugger




                                                                             1154



            1     being used during your surgery for the first time from your

            2     lawyers?

            3     A.  Yes.

            4     Q.  And was that about 2016 or so?

            5     A.  Yes, that's what I said, yeah.

            6     Q.  And you've explained to the ladies and gentlemen of the

            7     jury that you have some difficulty getting around and

            8     sleeping.  Is that pain on one side?

            9     A.  Well, I can't sleep very long on my right side.  I

           10     always have to sleep on my left side, that's one thing.  I

           11     can't drive -- I can drive a car, right?  That doesn't

           12     bother me too much, but I can only drive it for a certain

           13     length of time and then my hip starts -- I try to get on

           14     this side all the time, you know, and so I let my wife drive

           15     a lot and then I sit on the passenger side, on my left side

           16     like this and I can stand it for three hours.  That's why it

           17     took us so long to get up here.  We didn't fly.  My wife

           18     won't fly so we had drove.  My wife drove and it took us

           19     four days to get up here, you know.  We could have done it

           20     in two days, a normal person could have done it in two days,

           21     but it took us four days to get up here and --

           22     Q.  All right.  I don't think I have any other further

           23     questions for you right now, Coach.

           24     A.  No more questions?

           25     Q.  Nope.  I appreciate your patience.




                                                               1155



            1     A.  Okay.

            2               THE COURT:  Thank you Ms. Zimmerman.

            3     Mr. Blackwell.

            4               MR. BLACKWELL:  Thank you, Your Honor.

            5                          CROSS EXAMINATION

            6     BY MR. BLACKWELL:

            7     Q.  Good afternoon, Mr. Gareis.  You and I got a chance to

            8     meet for the first time probably on the first day of this

            9     trial?

           10     A.  Yes.

           11     Q.  Out in the hallway?

           12     A.  I remember that well.

           13     Q.  And we learned we had some -- at least a couple things

           14     in common despite sitting at opposite tables, so to speak,

           15     that we both have roots in the southeast.  And in fact, my

           16     folks and family right from Rock Hill which isn't too far

           17     from Columbia where you are, right?

           18     A.  Correct.

           19     Q.  You may not know too that we both played high school

           20     football, so I too know what it does to joints and things.

           21     A.  Mm-hmm.

           22     Q.  You know, I want to kind of go back to the beginning, so

           23     to speak.  You -- this lawsuit was started in roughly

           24     December of 2016?

           25     A.  Thinking back, I would say you're probably near or about




                                                               1156



            1     that, I would say.

            2     Q.  Now, could you tell us, first, how young a man are you,

            3     sir?

            4     A.  I'm not young.  I'm 76 years old.

            5     Q.  All right.  And you'll be 77 when?

            6     A.  December 6th.

            7     Q.  And I heard counsel when she sat down referred to you as

            8     coach.

            9     A.  That's correct.

           10     Q.  How long did you plan to go on coaching fast pitch

           11     softball?

           12     A.  Well, my upper body is pretty good right now.  If my

           13     lower body was as good as my upper body, I would be doing it

           14     right now.  I demonstrate a lot and so you have to be able

           15     to step out and use your legs and hips in order to throw a

           16     fast pitch softball and I'm not able to do that now.

           17     Q.  And you're hoping you could do that into your 80's?

           18     A.  Oh my gracious, yeah.  I would be doing it now.  It was

           19     the love of my life.  I was Coach Lou.  When you work for a

           20     big company, you're a number.  When you start your own

           21     business and everybody in the neighborhood knows you,

           22     everybody in the city knows me, everybody in the state knew

           23     me, Georgia, we had state champions in Georgia, state

           24     champions in North Carolina, ACC championships and North

           25     Carolina state, all of our pitchers, everybody knew me.




                                                               1157



            1     Q.  Well, with the time we have left before we have to break

            2     today, I wanted to go back through just a few of your

            3     medical records with you and --

            4     A.  Sure.

            5     Q.  -- and bring forward, bring the jury forward through the

            6     -- some of the different surgeries you had.  I wanted to

            7     start, though, with your back surgery.  And what was wrong

            8     with your back?

            9     A.  L4 and L5.  It was a simple surgery.  I walked out of

           10     the hospital.  Arthritis had kind of like pinched a nerve so

           11     he went and in cleaned it out, walked right out.

           12     Q.  And the L4, L5, that refers to the lower back --

           13     A.  Lower back.

           14     Q.  -- lumbar spine?

           15     A.  Correct.

           16     Q.  And what did they do?

           17     A.  I beg your pardon?

           18     Q.  What did they do?

           19     A.  According to the doctor, all she had to do was -- I

           20     don't know how they ground out the little pieces, you know,

           21     so I'm not a doctor so I don't know, but it was pretty

           22     simple procedure.

           23     Q.  It was a pinched nerve?

           24     A.  Right, yes.

           25     Q.  So let's go back to your first surgery on your left hip




                                                               1158



            1     was in March 2009?

            2     A.  Correct.

            3     Q.  That's what I see here.  So I want to go back to even

            4     before that into November 2008 because when the hips had

            5     gotten to the point of needing surgery, there had been quite

            6     a bit of time ramping up to that before they were bad enough

            7     to need surgery?

            8     A.  Sure.

            9     Q.  And so I first want to take a look at D411, 12.  So this

           10     record is dated November 11, 2008, and you can see it on the

           11     screen in front of you, sir?

           12     A.  Yes.

           13     Q.  And what here the doctor is noting that there is nearly

           14     complete obliteration of both hip joints superiorly but

           15     particularly on the left.  And here, the impression of the

           16     doctor was that there was advanced degenerative arthritic

           17     changes involving both hips.  There is nearly complete

           18     obliteration of the left hip joint.  Do you remember that

           19     both of your hips in November of 2008 had reached a point of

           20     being in pretty bad ship then?

           21     A.  Correct.  The worst one, like you said, was my life one,

           22     and that's why we did that first.

           23     Q.  Right.  So they hadn't weathered the same, they had worn

           24     differently, at the time the left was worse than the right?

           25     A.  At that time, yes.




                                                               1159



            1     Q.  So if we look forward, this is record D3450069 from

            2     Moore Orthopedics in Columbia May 7th, 2009, the Richland

            3     office, and so at this point you come into the office for

            4     followup from the left total hip arthoplasty so at this

            5     point you're about two months out from the surgery.  Can you

            6     see that there?

            7     A.  Yes.

            8     Q.  About nine weeks.  And at that point, they said he is

            9     doing very well, and you told us about that a few minutes

           10     ago.  He still notices a slight limp with his gait, allow he

           11     is walking without any assistance.  Do you remember any of

           12     that?

           13     A.  Sure.

           14     Q.  And the note here that the left hip had no pain with

           15     range of motion but the right hip at that point was

           16     bothering you, right hip does have pain with a range of

           17     motion.  Do you recall that?

           18     A.  Yes, that was going.  In the process.

           19     Q.  And so if we look here, moving forward still in time,

           20     April 1st, 2010, and this is record D3450064, and this is

           21     following on the left hip surgery too in April of 2010.  At

           22     this point you're a year out.  And the report here is that

           23     he states he is doing well.  He is having no problems with

           24     the left hip and, in fact, the only problem he is really

           25     having is with his right hip and the note is that the pain




                                                               1160



            1     is increasing but it's not severe.  Do you see that?

            2     A.  Uh-huh.

            3     Q.  Now, it was at this point in time that you were

            4     discussing with the doctor down here that you could see that

            5     you were going to likely need surgery on the right hip in

            6     the future?

            7     A.  Correct.

            8     Q.  And so that's in April of 2010, and you saw the doctor

            9     again in October of 2010, and your surgery that we've talked

           10     about here quite a bit was in November of 2010, but so

           11     you're ramping up to that, so we here we see in

           12     October 2010, a record D3450062, they note here that you

           13     came in, you had previously undergone a left total hip

           14     arthoplasty in 2009, doing well, but now your pain in the

           15     right hip is getting to the point that it's interfering with

           16     daily activities.  And do you recall that the pain had

           17     reached a point that even then that deteriorating right hip

           18     was causing you problems being able to sleep?

           19     A.  That's what I said.

           20     Q.  Yeah.  And so -- and at that point, the pain was severe

           21     enough and nothing else was really working so you knew that

           22     it was time to sit here for the plan to set up a surgery for

           23     the right side?

           24     A.  Correct.

           25     Q.  And that's when you planned to get the surgery done was




                                                               1161



            1     in October of 2010?

            2     A.  The months, the month that it was -- we're planning and

            3     things like that, I'm not exactly sure of.  Let me explain

            4     why.  When you have something this traumatic happen to you,

            5     I think your body or your mind tells you forget about it,

            6     you know, so I have a hard time remembering months and

            7     things like that and exactly what happened and some of the

            8     talks I had with the doctor, I remember a lot of them, been

            9     trying to, but for years after this traumatic surgery has

           10     happened I forgot about it, I pushed it out of my mind, I

           11     didn't even want to think about it because it destroyed my

           12     life to the point where, you know, I couldn't -- well, let's

           13     forget about that.  Let's just go on.

           14     Q.  And part of what made this particularly hard for you was

           15     you are used to being active and you were young at heart,

           16     right, you liked to be in motion and moving around?

           17     A.  Well, before I had my surgery on my right hip I used to

           18     job two or three miles a day.  I gained like 30 pounds after

           19     because if you can't jog and you can't be active, like

           20     you're perfectly right, then you're going to gain weight,

           21     that's just the way it is.

           22     Q.  But you had reached a point in the medical records and

           23     talking with your doctors, you were youthful at heart but

           24     the joints weren't holding up so well as you were ageing?

           25     A.  Correct.




                                                               1162



            1     Q.  And so you have that surgery on November 9th of 2010

            2     that we've been talking about here for over a week in the

            3     trial, and you were in the hospital for about, what, two

            4     days?

            5     A.  It wasn't a long time in any of the surgeries, you know.

            6     They kick you out pretty fast.

            7     Q.  So if I tell you it was two days and you were out, would

            8     you argue with that?

            9     A.  No, I'm not going to argue with you.

           10     Q.  And when they sent you home after that surgery, the

           11     wound where they had done the surgery was wrapped in

           12     bandages?

           13     A.  Yes.

           14     Q.  And how often did you have to change those?

           15     A.  I didn't change them at all.  The nurses did.  I had

           16     nurses who came to my house for weeks after my surgery and

           17     they're the ones ho care took of my wounds.

           18     Q.  I see.  And how often did the nurses come after the

           19     surgery --

           20     A.  Oh, gosh.

           21     Q.  -- to change the wounds -- or the bandage on the wounds?

           22     A.  I think they came every day for a while and then every

           23     day -- oh, change the bandages?

           24     Q.  Yes, sir.

           25     A.  They didn't change the bandages right away.  I'm not




                                                               1163



            1     sure how long.  They had a big thick bandage on my hips and

            2     that stayed on for I think a little while.  I wish I could

            3     remember all that, but, like I said, I put all that out of

            4     my mind, but they came and took care of me for, gosh, maybe

            5     four or five weeks at least, maybe six, maybe longer.

            6     Q.  How long did it ultimately take that wound to finally

            7     heal up?

            8     A.  You're talking about the one that became infected or the

            9     one --

           10     Q.  The -- I'm sorry, go ahead, sir.

           11     A.  I'm not sure which one you're talking about.  I had four

           12     surgeries.

           13     Q.  I'm talking about the -- that's true.  I'm talking about

           14     the wound that followed the right hip surgery in November of

           15     2010 and when you were at home and the nurses would come.

           16     A.  They all kind of run together but I'm not sure.  I can't

           17     answer that truthfully because I'm not exactly sure.

           18     Q.  Would you know whether it was over a month?

           19     A.  It was a matter of weeks.  How many weeks, I'm not sure.

           20     Maybe even over a month, could have been, but they came and

           21     changed the bandage.  And after the wound stopped weeping,

           22     then they were allowed to turn it over to my wife and they

           23     instructed her on how to take care of the wound after that,

           24     but that was a long time.

           25     Q.  I see.  So they changed the bandages on the wound until




                                                               1164



            1     it stopped weeping, right?

            2     A.  It seems to me like that's what they did, that was their

            3     job.

            4     Q.  Then your wife was able to take over?

            5     A.  Correct.

            6     Q.  And so when the wound had stopped weeping and your wife

            7     took over the changing of the bandages, the wound wasn't

            8     completely healed yet then either, it just wasn't weeping

            9     anymore.  Is that accurate?

           10     A.  The wound wasn't completely healed, I don't know what

           11     you mean by that.  It was pretty well healed because there

           12     was nothing coming out of it anymore.  It looked like a

           13     regular wound.  That happened with all my surgeries, not

           14     just that one.

           15     Q.  I was only asking, sir, because if you had still had the

           16     bandage and it was still being changed, I was wondering why

           17     you needed the bandage if it was healed?

           18     A.  It was a small bandage that after the nurses, they

           19     instructed my wife, it was like a pad that she went around

           20     the drug store and bought and then a couple of pieces of

           21     tape on it.  So it was pretty well healed, when they

           22     released me to my wife and instructed her how to take care

           23     of the wound, that's -- it was a small bandage.  It wasn't a

           24     big bandage like they were using.

           25     Q.  Just two more records.




                                                               1165



            1     A.  Sure.

            2     Q.  This one is from March 24, 2011.  It's record D345-0055.

            3     And again, this is sometime after the total right hip

            4     surgery.  And here the comment was that you were doing

            5     great, the right hip, until the weekend.  You worked a full

            6     day on Saturday, and worked a full day was with fast pitch

            7     softball?

            8     A.  Correct.

            9     Q.  And then after working that full day you developed

           10     severe pain to the point where you couldn't walk.

           11     A.  Mm-hmm.

           12     Q.  And so they noted that you were still complaining of

           13     pain mostly posterior in the hip and not really anterior in

           14     the groin and they gave you an x-ray.  Do you remember that?

           15     A.  No, but I -- they probably did.  I can't remember that.

           16     Q.  Well, the record indicates here that after the x-that

           17     ray he has no signs of any complications.  Do you recall

           18     when you visited with the doctor after this visit the

           19     doctors ever telling you that they looked at the x-rays and

           20     saw in it any infection or anything?

           21     A.  They told -- Dr. Presnal told me, and I asked him this

           22     specifically, can you see an infection in x-ray, and he said

           23     most of the time no.  He says I'm not sure -- we're not sure

           24     about that.  He was looking at the x-ray to see if something

           25     had a dislodged or, you know, something happened to the




                                                               1166



            1     implant.  That's what he told me anyhow, and so I asked him

            2     I said, can you see an infection in there?  He says not

            3     really unless it's really, really bad.

            4     Q.  So when he looked at it, then, looking for any sign of a

            5     complication?

            6     A.  That's correct.

            7     Q.  The record indicates he didn't see any signs of

            8     complication?

            9     A.  That's correct.

           10     Q.  And last one I want to ask you about is from July 9th of

           11     2012.  And so at this point you're about a year out from the

           12     right hip surgery.  How many months was that?

           13     A.  How many months?

           14     Q.  I'm just reading here on second sentence it says, He is

           15     now about almost one year?

           16     A.  Okay.

           17     Q.  Although your surgery was November 9, 2010, so this is

           18     in fact more than a year out, isn't it, sir?

           19     A.  Correct.

           20     Q.  And they said here that he states that his right hip is

           21     doing okay, he has no complaints of the left hip, he can

           22     walk up to one to two miles a day without any difficulty.

           23     Do you recall then being able to walk up to a mile or two

           24     day without any difficulty?  And this is when you had in the

           25     antibiotic spacer.  Do you remember discussing that with




                                                               1167



            1     your doctor?

            2     A.  After I -- a long time after I had that spacer, when the

            3     infection was gone, the infection was out.  They had

            4     released me from the hospital.  I didn't have to have any

            5     more blood work done and the pain had gone away.  I was

            6     ready to get that spacer out.  Then I was basically cured

            7     then.  And the spacer was great because it enabled me to do

            8     a lot almost like a regular one, so then they decided to

            9     take that the spacer out after I had been cured and put in

           10     the permanent.

           11     Q.  And do you recall, though, while the spacer was in, as

           12     you reported to your doctors, do you recall being able to

           13     walk up to a mile or two day without any difficulty?

           14     A.  Yeah, after my infection was over, yeah, that's correct.

           15     Q.  And so then you finally had the permanent implant

           16     reinserted into your right hip and whereas before you had

           17     any surgery the left hip was slightly worse than the right

           18     and now the today the right is worse than the left?

           19     A.  After I had the permanent put in, I talked to --

           20     Dr. Presnal said you're never going to be the same, after

           21     three surgeries, I don't think anybody, any doctor would

           22     expect you to be the same as after one.  You understand what

           23     I'm saying, after three surgeries, everything has been -- I

           24     told him to put a zipper on there is what I told him because

           25     I had so many surgeries on that one side, and it's never




                                                               1168



            1     going to get back to the same, I don't think, although I

            2     have improved.  I'm a lot better now than I was a couple

            3     years ago.

            4     Q.  And so what do you attribute the improvement to?  Just

            5     being able to work with it more?

            6     A.  Time.  Oh, sure.  Like I said, I threw that crutch away.

            7     I wasn't going to use it anymore.  Sure, I could use it some

            8     time and it would help me, but I threw it away.  What do I

            9     attribute it to?  I played football.

           10     Q.  Oh, you mean that's what caused it way back when?

           11     A.  No.  I attribute it to me getting better; because I

           12     played football, I had tenacity.

           13     Q.  And so you think with tenacity and just keeping at it --

           14     A.  Right.

           15     Q.  -- and keep in mind that you will --

           16     A.  You are right.  Absolutely.

           17     Q.  You'll be able to increase your range of motion?

           18     A.  Absolutely.

           19     Q.  Let me switch gears and ask you about something that

           20     counsel brought up.  You like Dr. Presnal and you think of

           21     him as a very good doctor, right?

           22     A.  I do.

           23     Q.  Now, this idea of connecting the Bair Hugger with the

           24     infection in your right hip didn't come from Dr. Presnal,

           25     did it?




                                                               1169



            1     A.  No.

            2     Q.  And so the sole source of the idea that the Bair Hugger

            3     is connected to your infection came from the lawyers, true?

            4     A.  It came from a lot of, a lot of reading that I've done

            5     myself.  It wasn't just the lawyers.  I -- what happened to

            6     me caused me to -- and I don't blame Dr. Presnal at all.  He

            7     was just doing what all the doctors do.  That's just

            8     standard procedure to use a Bair Hugger.  And I did a lot of

            9     research, okay, but that was after the lawyers told me about

           10     it, I did research on my own to see if I -- believe me, I

           11     didn't take this lawsuit lightly.  I didn't.  I didn't want

           12     to do it.  Really, I didn't want to do it, but I --

           13     Q.  I understand.  Now, Mr. Gareis, we had a chance to talk

           14     to you in a deposition in November of 2017 and we did ask

           15     you about this.  Do you remember that?

           16     A.  Parts of it.

           17     Q.  Yeah.  Would you like to see the question and answer we

           18     had about that?  I can give you a copy.

           19     A.  No.  Just tell me and I'll let you know.

           20     Q.  All right.  Well, this was the exchange, and there was

           21     some interruptions where the lawyer is asking you about

           22     this.

           23               And he says, I don't want you to tell me anything

           24     your attorney shared with you, but after you saw the ad,

           25     have you gotten any information from anyone, again, other




                                                               1170



            1     than your attorneys, about the Bair Hugger or how that --

            2               Answer, no.

            3               -- how it might have impacted you?

            4               And you said, I haven't.

            5               Question.  So the sole source of information would

            6     be what your attorneys --

            7               And you said, what I talked to them about it,

            8     yeah.

            9               Do you remember saying that?

           10     A.  I remember saying that, yes.

           11     Q.  Now, sitting here in court, you've heard from a number

           12     of different experts who are, I guess, ostensibly testifying

           13     on your behalf.  Now, you heard them on the stand where you

           14     are sitting, didn't you, sir?

           15     A.  Yes, I did.

           16     Q.  Can you -- well, first of all, can we agree they're all

           17     pretty well paid, aren't they?

           18     A.  I'm not very well paid.  I know that.  I drove up here.

           19     I paid for my own gas.  I stopped three times to motels.  I

           20     ain't got a penny.

           21     Q.  Understood.

           22     A.  But I came up here because I really feel this is

           23     important.

           24     Q.  And it is.  It is important to have your day, but a

           25     question about those experts.  Has a single one of them ever




                                                               1171



            1     come to see you at your house?

            2     A.  At my house?

            3     Q.  Yes, sir.

            4     A.  I don't know if that would be necessary for what they

            5     were testifying to, but no.

            6     Q.  Do you know if a single one of them has ever talked to

            7     Dr. Presnal?

            8     A.  Let me think.  I'm not sure about that.  I don't know.

            9     Q.  Do you have any reason to think a single one of them

           10     ever went to the hospital Operating Room No. 4 where you had

           11     your surgery?

           12     A.  I don't think they did seven years later.

           13     Q.  Do you think that seven years later a single one of them

           14     even looked at a picture of your operating room, except

           15     the --

           16     A.  I don't know what a picture would prove, but, I mean, go

           17     ahead.  I'll answer -- I'll answer no.  Go ahead.

           18     Q.  So I'm just trying to set the stage for the relationship

           19     they actually have with you.  Now, you did see

           20     Dr. Stonnington?

           21     A.  Yes.

           22     Q.  And you flew Mississippi to see him?

           23     A.  Yes.

           24     Q.  And is it fair you spent maybe anywhere from a half hour

           25     to an hour with Dr. Stonnington in Mississippi?




                                                               1172



            1     A.  I would say it was more closer to -- I don't know if it

            2     was more than an hour, less than an hour, but it was, you're

            3     right, it was close.

            4     Q.  Right, right.  It wasn't a long time?

            5     A.  No.

            6     Q.  You had mentioned your -- in talking about the softball

            7     business, you said it wasn't a business that necessarily

            8     made a lot of money for you.

            9     A.  We're changing the subject?

           10     Q.  Yes, sir.

           11     A.  Okay.

           12     Q.  It was a business that hadn't made a lot of money for

           13     you, but it's something that you really enjoy doing.

           14     A.  Correct.

           15     Q.  I wanted to at least have the jury understand at least

           16     what the income was from the business, in case that's

           17     relevant to discussions later on.

           18     A.  Oh.  Are you asking the question?

           19     Q.  Yes, I'm leading up to one --

           20     A.  Okay.

           21     Q.  -- in just a minute.  So I'm going to represent to you

           22     what is in the tax returns for the income claimed from the

           23     business, and I'll cite it to the record for your attorneys

           24     so that they can verify it, and then I want to ask you a

           25     question about it.




                                                               1173



            1     A.  Okay.

            2     Q.  In 2005, there was a claim of income of $9,652, and

            3     that's from Exhibit D953-001 and 003;

            4               2006, $4,870, and that's from again 953-0006 and

            5     0008;

            6               2007, $5,872, again, D953-0012 and 0014;

            7               2008, $7,024.  That's from D953-0017 and 0019;

            8               2009, 4,765, 0001 and 0003;

            9               And then 2010, $2,402.  And that's D952-0005;

           10               For an average net profit for that time period of

           11     $5,764.

           12               I think you told us that after that surgery on

           13     November 9, 2010, and the revision that you took place you

           14     weren't able to keep up with the business the same way

           15     because of the right hip.

           16     A.  You're just giving the net.  You're not giving the

           17     gross.  Correct?

           18     Q.  That's right, sir.

           19     A.  Okay.

           20     Q.  I'm just giving what was reported as the --

           21     A.  If you notice that there's a big difference, because I

           22     didn't charge a lot of money.  I only charged a little over

           23     what it cost me to rent the buildings, to pay the electric,

           24     to pay the insurance and other incidentals that I had to pay

           25     for because I tried to keep my prices down for low-income




                                                               1174



            1     people.

            2     Q.  I appreciate that, and it's a good thing.  But the

            3     numbers I reported here overall sound about right for the

            4     net income, not the gross, the net income?

            5     A.  Correct.  That changed too because I had to change

            6     buildings.  In other words, I made less money certain times

            7     because I changed buildings.  I had a smaller building and I

            8     went to a bigger building, which cost me a lot more money.

            9     So the figures you're giving doesn't take into account for

           10     that or for a lot of the other things.

           11     Q.  I'm simply reporting what was in the --

           12     A.  I know what you're doing.

           13     Q.  I have to finish my question, of course.  I'm just

           14     simply reporting what was in the net income on the tax

           15     returns.

           16     A.  Correct.

           17     Q.  And I didn't misquote anything, as far as you know?

           18     A.  No, no.  It's correct.

           19     Q.  And finally, sir, with respect to the fast-pitch

           20     coaching, if we take nothing else from your testimony, we

           21     take from it the fact it was something that you loved to do.

           22     A.  Uh-huh.

           23     Q.  And would you say that the fast-pitch coaching and what

           24     had drawn you to it was something that you didn't want to

           25     lose money on?




                                                            1175



            1     A.  Correct.

            2     Q.  But you weren't doing it necessarily to make all the

            3     money you could?

            4     A.  That's for sure.

            5     Q.  All right.  And so, Mr. Gareis, I think I don't want to

            6     ask you any further questions.  Thank you for your time.

            7     A.  That's it?  I like talking to you.  I'm sorry.

            8               THE COURT:  Thank you, Mr. Blackwell.

            9               Ms. Zimmerman, anything else?

           10                        REDIRECT EXAMINATION

           11     BY MS. ZIMMERMAN:

           12     Q.  Mr. Gareis, Mr. Blackwell showed you some of your

           13     medical records.

           14     A.  Uh-huh.

           15     Q.  And you recall that.  One of them was from March 24th of

           16     2011 -- or pardon -- yes, 2011, and it said that your

           17     incision was well-healed.  Is that consistent with your

           18     recollection as well?

           19     A.  My incision was well-healed?

           20     Q.  Yes.

           21     A.  Say that again, just so I get it straight.

           22     Q.  He was showing you some of your medical records from

           23     March of 2011, and the record itself said that your incision

           24     was well-healed.

           25     A.  Yes.




                                                           1176



            1     Q.  That's consistent with what you remember too?

            2     A.  Yes.

            3     Q.  I don't have anything further for you.

            4               THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.

            5               And you may step down.

            6               All right.  Members of the jury, we'll be in

            7     recess until tomorrow morning at 9:00.
