21   EXAMINATION BY MR. BERGMAN:
22   
23         Q.   Good morning.
0008
 1         A.   Good morning.
 2         Q.   Could you please state your full
 3   name for the record?
 4         A.   Troy Cottles.
 5         Q.   Where do you live, Mr. Cottles?
 6         A.   In Toney Alabama.
 7         Q.   And have you been designated as an
 8   expert witness in this, Smith versus China
 9   Manufacturers Alliance?
10         A.   Yes.
11         Q.   When were you first retained?
12         A.   The first invoice that I have is
13   from -- dated April the 8th of 2019.  There
14   may have been communication prior to that and
15   most likely was but that's the first time I
16   billed in the case.
17         Q.   So that's your first invoice?
18         A.   That's right.
19              MR. BERGMAN:  And -- and, for the
20   record, Mr. Cottles is looking through a box
21   of documents he has.  We'll go through that,
22   the contents of that box in a bit.
23         Q.   And who was it that retained you,
0009
 1   Mr. Cottles?
 2         A.   Aub Ward.
 3              THE WITNESS:  It's spelled A-u-b.
 4         Q.   Prior to this case have you worked
 5   with Mr. Ward before?
 6         A.   No, I don't think so.
 7         Q.   Prior to this case have you worked
 8   with his law firm, the Gordon Law Group,
 9   before?
10         A.   Not that I recall.
11         Q.   What was it that you were asked to
12   do by Mr. Ward?
13         A.   Initially to look at the evidence
14   and determine if there was causations that I
15   could identify for the failure that occurred
16   of the tire and then later as materials were
17   produced I was to review that.
18              And, of course, I've been working
19   more directly with the Kaster Lynch Law Firm
20   since that point in time.
21         Q.   When was the first time you saw
22   the tire at issue in this case?
23         A.   It would've been when I invoiced,
0010
 1   April the 8th, 2019, within a couple weeks
 2   of that timeframe when I actually got to the
 3   evidence.
 4              So I'm not saying I know when the
 5   tire arrived but a couple of weeks after I
 6   would've received it I would have begun my
 7   analysis of it.
 8         Q.   Okay.  So was the tire sent to you
 9   then?
10         A.   Yes.
11         Q.   Sent to you at -- where was it
12   sent to?
13         A.   To my office in Toney, Alabama.
14         Q.   Toney, Alabama.
15              Upon receiving the tire, you said
16   it would be a few weeks before you looked at
17   it?
18         A.   I'm saying within a couple weeks
19   I think I would've looked at it upon receipt
20   and the first invoice was after the initial
21   work was done, which was April the 8th, 2019.
22         Q.   Okay.  Could I see that first
23   invoice, please?
0011
 1         A.   Yes.
 2         Q.   Is this all of your invoices in
 3   the case?
 4         A.   So far, yes.
 5         Q.   Looking at the invoices, it looks
 6   like you have kind of a summary, it says like
 7   you know 5 hours or 3 hours.
 8              Is there anymore detail as to what
 9   you did in that time period?
10         A.   No.
11         Q.   Okay.  So --
12         A.   I said "No" to that question but
13   some of those don't just say "5 hours."  Some
14   of them have some detail broken out.
15         Q.   Right, some might say like, you
16   know, some shipping or things like that?
17         A.   That's right.
18         Q.   All right.  So, looking through
19   these invoices, I'll ask for the copies of
20   them to be produced.
21              After you were retained in April,
22   2019 and the tire -- the tire at issue was
23   shipped to you, how long did you keep it for?
0012
 1         A.   It looks like -- and I can't test-
 2   ify as to when exactly I received it but when
 3   I billed for the work of dismounting and x-
 4   raying the tread piece and so forth was April
 5   the 8th of 2019 and I shipped on April the
 6   10th, so two days after I invoiced for the
 7   dismounting of the tire from the rim and the
 8   x-raying of the tread piece and so forth.
 9         Q.   So you had the tire for a period
10   of time April maybe a little earlier in 2019
11   and then after you had reviewed the tire you
12   shipped it back to Mr. Ward in April of 2019?
13         A.   That's right.
14         Q.   We'll go through those invoices.
15   I see that you later received the companion
16   tire.
17         A.   Correct.
18         Q.   Did you ask for the companion tire
19   at that time or how did that come about?
20         A.   I don't recall a specific convers-
21   ation about it but I -- I can't -- I can't
22   tell you if I asked or if it was already in
23   the works to be removed and delivered to me.
0013
 1   I don't remember seeing it.
 2         Q.   And, when the companion tire was
 3   sent to you, was it just the companion tire
 4   or both tires sent to you?
 5         A.   What do you mean by "both tires"?
 6         Q.   Well, so you -- we established
 7   that sometime around April of 2019 you got
 8   the subject tire.
 9         A.   Right.
10         Q.   And then you said on April 10th it
11   looks like you shipped the subject tire back
12   to Plaintiff's counsel?
13         A.   Correct.
14         Q.   And then about a year later your
15   invoices indicate you received the companion
16   tire and -- and looked at it.
17         A.   Correct.
18         Q.   Did you also receive the subject
19   tire again at that time or just the companion
20   tire?
21         A.   My rec -- best recollection is
22   that I just received the companion tire at
23   that time; but, as far as the sequencing of
0014
 1   receivables of the tires, when you look at
 2   the CD of my -- when I took my photographs
 3   and you can see the data for the dates on
 4   those photographs, that may sort that out
 5   better than my memory does right mow.
 6         Q.   Okay.  And have you provided your
 7   photographs and videos to counsel for produc-
 8   tion yet?
 9         A.   No.
10         Q.   Okay.
11         A.   Understanding we were doing this
12   live and the Exhibit A not requiring it, I
13   just brought it with me today but we can make
14   it exhibits of whatever you need.
15         Q.   Yeah, I -- I -- I would ask for
16   the copies of all the pictures that you took
17   and all the videos you made to be produced as
18   well.
19              Do you know how many pictures you
20   did take?
21         A.   Four boxes plus those that I tried
22   to collect separately based on what I assumed
23   some topics may be about some of the images
0015
 1   there.  I think it's like 700 but I'm not
 2   positive.
 3         Q.   That would be both tires or just
 4   the subject tire?
 5         A.   In total.
 6         Q.   Okay.  And then the videos were
 7   the videos of you mounting and dismount the
 8   tire from the wheels?
 9         A.   Having it done, yes.
10         Q.   Okay.  Any -- any other videos or
11   just that?
12         A.   I think I've shearographic video
13   as well of the companion tire.
14         Q.   Did you x-ray the tires?
15         A.   Yes, the subject tire's tread
16   piece was x-rayed.  I think I've got that in
17   hard copy.
18              Yeah, I x-rayed the subject tire's
19   tread piece.
20         Q.   Okay.
21         A.   If there are any other x-rays,
22   they were produced for me.  I didn't x-ray
23   any other parts of the tire.
0016
 1         Q.   Okay.  So the -- what -- what I'll
 2   refer to as the carcass of the subject tire,
 3   you did not x-ray that?
 4         A.   Correct.
 5         Q.   In examining the subject tire --
 6   actually, strike that.
 7              So April, 2019 you had the subject
 8   tire, you shipped it back.  Have you seen the
 9   subject tire since then?
10         A.   I don't have a recollection of
11   having seen it twice.
12         Q.   Okay.  If you could describe for
13   me generally the examination process that you
14   followed with the subject tire from the time
15   it was received until the time you sent it
16   back.
17         A.   So, basically, that examination
18   process is how my notes outline what -- what
19   I'm looking at and that starts at page 19 of
20   my report and after we got the tire separated
21   from the rim, first -- first of all, starting
22   with how it's uncrated or unwrapped and ob-
23   serving how it's received photographing that.
0017
 1              And then secondly I go through a
 2   process of collecting the stamping off of the
 3   tire, off the sidewalls and any interior
 4   stamping that may or may not exist.
 5              And then beyond that is starting
 6   to then inspect the surfaces of the sidewalls
 7   starting with the serial side going to the
 8   serial opposite side looking at the interior,
 9   doing the tread carcass or any portions of
10   the carcass that may have tread remaining,
11   and then going to the detached surfaces and
12   measuring tread depths and so forth in addi-
13   tion to notating anything of interest in what
14   is observed on the surfaces, separated sur-
15   faces especially; looking at the rim, going
16   through its marking process, and then looking
17   at doing the inspection of that afterwards.
18              I did the same process sequence
19   for the right front companion tire as well.
20         Q.   So, looking at your report -- or,
21   actually, before we do that what's been mark-
22   ed as Cottles Exhibit 1, is this the report
23   that you prepared for this case?
0018
 1              (Defendant's Exhibit Number 1 was
 2   marked for identification.)
 3         A.   Yes.
 4         Q.   If I understand you correctly, the
 5   notes that you have here beginning on page 19
 6   and going through, let's see, looks like page
 7   23, that -- that is actually the process by
 8   which you did each of those steps as well; is
 9   that correct?
10         A.   The sequencing, yeah.
11         Q.   Okay.
12         A.   It's laid out in the sequence I'm
13   basically doing.
14         Q.   And simplifying it a little bit
15   but -- so, based on this, you received the
16   tires, you had it dismounted on the little
17   videotape.
18              You then started with the serial
19   side, looked at the markings, turned the tire
20   over and looked for the other side markings
21   and the interior markings.
22              So each step here would describe
23   what you did?
0019
 1         A.   Yes.
 2         Q.   And then is there a worksheet that
 3   you used to make these notes or were they
 4   just done on a normal legal pad or how -- how
 5   would you keep these notes prior to them be-
 6   ing incorporated into your report like this?
 7         A.   I dictated and it's typed as I
 8   speak.
 9         Q.   So you don't have a worksheet that
10   you're filling out, you're literally just
11   speaking to a -- your phone or a Dictaphone
12   or something like that?
13         A.   My paralegal is typing as I speak.
14         Q.   Okay.  Who's your paralegal?
15         A.   Amber Williams.
16         Q.   How long has she worked for you?
17         A.   12 or 13 years now.
18         Q.   In the photographs that you took
19   of the tire and the rim, when were those tak-
20   en, during this inspection process or separ-
21   ate from this inspection process?
22         A.   During the inspection process but
23   at the end after I've made comments and then
0020
 1   I go and document photographically what I've
 2   just expressed in -- in my notes.
 3         Q.   In doing that -- so, for example,
 4   when you're talking about here about serial
 5   side markings, would you dictate your find-
 6   ings and then take the pictures and then go
 7   to the other side or will you do it -- the
 8   pictures more at the end of the process?
 9         A.   It's more at the end of the whole
10   process, you know, batching that work togeth-
11   er; so discussing, putting lights on the tire
12   setting the tire up for inspection, getting
13   it lit up; and then talking about what I'm
14   seeing around it, making crayon marks for de-
15   gree location references when I'm doing the
16   inspection.
17              And then, once I'm through with
18   talking about it, I'll go around with that
19   lighting and my camera and document that
20   photographically.
21         Q.   And, other than what's listed here
22   on pages 19 through 23 regarding the subject
23   tire and the rim, are there -- is there any-
0021
 1   thing else that you did as part of your
 2   inspection process of the tire?
 3         A.   I had the x-rays produced for the
 4   tread -- separated tread piece.  That's I
 5   think generally it.  I can't think of a spec-
 6   ific other area of investigation.
 7              I measured the tread depths.  I
 8   looked at the rim grooves to the ability pos-
 9   sible with this evidence.  I looked for cond-
10   itions on the tire or the absence of those
11   conditions in sorting through my findings to
12   see what I believed to be evidence of the
13   causations of the tread separation event and
14   doc -- documented that either photographic-
15   ally or in measurement.
16         Q.   And the -- the shearography -- the
17   shearography, you only did that of the com-
18   panion tire; is that correct?
19         A.   Correct.
20         Q.   Is there a reason you did not do
21   it of the subject tire?
22         A.   You can't do it with the subject
23   tire.  It's already separated.  There's no
0022
 1   way to pull back a tire that's burned and
 2   separated.
 3         Q.   So when I'm looking at your report
 4   these notes that are in here from pages 19 to
 5   23, these would've been created at or about
 6   April of 2019.  Is that fair understanding of
 7   what you've testified?
 8         A.   For the subject tire, yes.
 9         Q.   And the companion tire would've
10   been approximately a year later; right?
11         A.   Yes.
12         Q.   The report itself that you submit-
13   ted in this case, when did you prepare the --
14   the remainder of the report?
15         A.   Well, I may be missing one of my
16   in- voices.  I'll have to look.  I don't see
17   where I billed for writing the report.
18              So I don't have a date to point --
19   point you to.  I would've relied upon the
20   invoice for that.
21              I'm not seeing it so I'll have to
22   look back through.  I had two files to pull
23   invoices out of to make copies of.  I'll
0023
 1   search again.  I don't see it.
 2         Q.   There's nothing on your report
 3   that would tell you when you prepared it?
 4         A.   No.  I didn't date them.
 5         Q.   So, in terms of -- was there any
 6   kind of tests that you ran on the subject
 7   tire?
 8         A.   I would say the x-raying itself
 9   was the only thing that was nontactile visual
10   inspection, which are the standards in my
11   field; but nothing of a rubber sample or
12   something like that, no.
13         Q.   And, for example, with the subject
14   tire or the companion tire, did you do any
15   kind of strength testing of the rubber?
16         A.   No.
17         Q.   So is there anything else that you
18   did as part of your inspection of the tire
19   that we haven't covered?
20         A.   Not that occurs to me, no.
21         Q.   So the sequence is set forth in
22   your report, you took some pictures and video
23   and you x-rayed the tread piece.
0024
 1              So that -- that's the sum of what
 2   you did with this tire; is that correct?
 3         A.   Best I can recall, yes.
 4         Q.   Let's turn to your report.  Looks
 5   like these first -- from pages 3 to 9, this
 6   is a summary of -- your summary of the tire
 7   manufacturing process; is that right?
 8         A.   Yes, a general summary of it.
 9         Q.   Is this based on any specific tire
10   factory?
11         A.   No.
12         Q.   All right.  So, in looking at the
13   summary, I mea, have you -- have you visited
14   any tire factory as part of putting this sum-
15   mary together?
16         A.   Well, this summary comes from 17
17   years in the industry plus I've seen other
18   factories outside of that 17 years.
19              So it's a conglomeration of my
20   understanding of the typical means and ways
21   that tires are produced and it's just meant
22   to express to the judge and the jury that I
23   understand the sequence, that these things
0025
 1   occur in a particular order and for a partic-
 2   ular purpose.
 3              And then just after this I talk
 4   about how tires can be designed and so it's
 5   sort of the same effort to demonstrate know
 6   how based on -- based on my experience and
 7   training, education I received throughout
 8   that 17 years because -- because, while I
 9   promoted through the engineering section of
10   Dunlop and Goodyear Dunlop into upper manage-
11   ment and ended as a director of the joint
12   venture on the technical side, I developed
13   tires throughout my experience.  I never was
14   without projects that I was managing and/or
15   developing and tuning the tire for the cus-
16   tomer requirement.
17              So that's just the know how I'm
18   trying to express in a generic way for the
19   purposes of the jury and the judges in this
20   case.
21         Q.   And, when you say in 17 years of
22   experience, you're referring to from July of
23   '88 when you started with Dunlop Tire through
0026
 1   2005?
 2         A.   Yes.
 3         Q.   I mean, I can see it here on your
 4   -- on your resume but just briefly describe
 5   your 17 years at Dunlop and Goodyear?
 6         A.   So I started in Huntsville, we had
 7   a factory operating here in Huntsville and I
 8   started in the original equipment organiza-
 9   tion and that was the group that designed
10   tires for OEM vehicles; Toyota, Honda, Nissan
11   Mazda, later Mercedes.
12              So the specific tire requirements
13   they had for endurance and high speed and
14   roller resistance and noise and snow traction
15   wet traction, dry traction, ride comfort,
16   those things were all areas of tire perform-
17   ance that I had responsibility for.
18              So I tuned tires in the factory to
19   meet these end requirements of those customer
20   and I had a responsibility and I was taught
21   how to develop the green tire -- what we call
22   "green tire" means before the tire is cured
23   -- components; beads and inner liners and
0027
 1   body plies and belts and tread and sidewalls,
 2   nylon, and so forth and they could be used in
 3   the tire.
 4              I could design those components
 5   and the dimensions of those components and
 6   then request them of the factory, have the
 7   tires built, and then take the finished tire
 8   and test it at an outdoor proving ground and
 9   at an indoor test facilities or on the
10   vehicle and then jointly with those customers
11   all over the world; so Stuttgart to Tokyo to
12   wherever our customers had home bases and in
13   their North American facilities.
14              So that's what I spent my initial
15   time at Dunlop in in the technical division
16   was focusing on how to make the tires meet
17   the customer requirements without failing in
18   -- in a predictable way and working on moving
19   out the failure modes from a design perspec-
20   tive knowing how we were going to process the
21   tire through the manufacturing process and
22   accommodating both of those to try to make
23   tires more durable for those applications in
0028
 1   the field.
 2              Secondly, after doing that for
 3   some time, I went to Torrance outside of Los
 4   Angeles and I worked as field service rep in
 5   that facility for those customers and gather-
 6   ed tire data with them and then sent that
 7   tire data back to our headquarters for deal-
 8   ing with the claims but also started inte-
 9   grating the engineering group with the ser-
10   vice people so that designers could go see
11   what's happening and fix it on the fly, which
12   is not something I've seen in the testimony
13   in this instance is that that's not done, the
14   -- the designers aren't involved with the
15   field performance collection to the degree
16   that it changes anything.
17              And so that -- that was something
18   that I integrated as a result of being an
19   engineer, tire engineer there.  It integrated
20   our service representatives with engineers
21   and coupled engineers with them to go meet
22   the customers at dealers or wherever or at
23   national regional offices or the national
0029
 1   offices like were in Torrance.
 2              And so I decided the claims were
 3   accepted or not acceptable jointly with Toy-
 4   ota or Nissan or Honda, whomever; and then
 5   those that we accepted I sent back to head-
 6   quarters to be paid.  So that was one aspect
 7   of the work I did.
 8              And then I came back from that and
 9   was promoted to senior engineer and took on
10   more project responsibilities, soon after I
11   became manager of the organization when our
12   manager retired and then promoted to senior
13   manager and took on more product responsibil-
14   ities; meaning, not just passenger and light
15   truck OE tires but started taking on respons-
16   ibilities for other projects in the joint
17   venture such as ATV tires and at a later date
18   motorcycle tires for a short while as I pro-
19   moted to director of the technical division.
20         Q.   Is it -- am I correct that your
21   experience did not include medium or heavy
22   duty truck tires?
23         A.   My responsibilities didn't include
0030
 1   it.  My -- certainly my experiences did.
 2              Heavy duty median truck tires were
 3   manufactured in the Buffalo facility where I
 4   spent some years and I observed them being
 5   manufactured, I talked to their design engin-
 6   eering staff.  We had regular group meetings
 7   and all of that, the technologies and the is-
 8   sues were all communicated and we looked at
 9   field data together as -- on a quarterly bas-
10   is at least.
11              And so it was comingled.  I didn't
12   have a responsibility for it but I certainly
13   understood the technologies used in man --
14   manufacturing the tires.
15              I saw similarities of how their
16   tires were manufactured for medium truck ver-
17   sus passenger and light trucks; more robust
18   designs, more belts, for example.  A steel
19   body ply instead of polyester body ply but
20   otherwise larger more industrial directed but
21   pretty much steel belted radial tires none-
22   theless.
23              So I had interactions with them
0031
 1   throughout my experience in Akron and Buffalo
 2   but I didn't have responsibility to design
 3   the product or evaluate it but I did make
 4   myself familiar with it with because it was
 5   one of the products our company made.
 6         Q.   So, when you were in Akron, you
 7   were senior manager of OEM passenger tires as
 8   well; is that correct?
 9         A.   That's correct.
10         Q.   And then you moved to Buffalo in
11   January of 2003.  You were a senior technical
12   manager you said responsible for ATV and OEM
13   passenger program I think you described it.
14         A.   Yeah, I continued the passenger
15   work and then added ATV.
16         Q.   And am I reading this correct, you
17   were only the technical director for about a
18   month?
19         A.   That's right.
20         Q.   What was the reason that you left
21   Dunlop, the Goodyear Dunlop in -- Goodyear
22   Dunlop in July of 2005?
23         A.   I asked to go home.
0032
 1              I've told this case multiple times
 2   but I asked to go back to Alabama.  All our
 3   family was here; my mother contracted cancer,
 4   my wife's mother suddenly died.  I asked to
 5   move back and I was told that that wasn't a
 6   possibility at the time.  They just moved me
 7   to Buffalo two years before and that there
 8   was a different plan.
 9              So I asked "Well, what is that
10   plan, you haven't discussed it with me," and
11   I was told that the president was going to
12   retire the following year, my vice president
13   was going to move to his position and I was
14   going to move to the vice president position.
15              And it just -- it would've been a
16   great promotion.  It was probably what I had
17   always hoped to have happen but it didn't fit
18   me personally at the time and I felt like my
19   family was struggling here so I put out my
20   resume.
21              They found out that I was looking
22   for opportunities back toward home and the
23   company called me into the HR Department and
0033
 1   asked me I had been talking to other tire
 2   companies and I had.
 3              So they gave me a severance pack-
 4   age and I took it.  I went home by the end
 5   of that week.  So I've been here ever since.
 6         Q.   And have you worked for yourself
 7   since July of 2005?
 8         A.   Yes.
 9         Q.   Going back to your report and you
10   talking about the tire manufacturing process,
11   have you been to any of -- any factory that
12   is operated by Shanghai Huayi Group Corpora-
13   tion Limited?
14         A.   No, I haven't.
15         Q.   Okay.  Have you seen any factory
16   overseas?
17         A.   Yes.
18         Q.   What factories overseas have you
19   seen?
20         A.   Hankook's factory in Dijon.
21         Q.   Any others?
22         A.   Yeah, that's in the -- in this
23   consulting context but, prior to that, I had
0034
 1   been to Japan, I had seen Sumitomo's factory
 2   in Shirakawa and Kobe and Nagoya.  I had seen
 3   Dunlop Germany's factories in had Hanau.  I
 4   have seen Goodyear's factories in Canada.
 5              So, if overseas is the question,
 6   that's -- overseas or other countries, that's
 7   -- that's my answer to that.
 8              In litigation I've seen the South
 9   Korean factory of Hankook that I mentioned
10   and then stateside I've seen Continental
11   Tires in Mt. Vernon, Illinois.
12         Q.   So the tire manufacturing process
13   here that goes from page 3 to page 9, is this
14   a standard insert in your reports?
15         A.   Yes.  It took me about two weeks
16   to write it and once I had written it and I
17   may have adjusted it word for -- you know, a
18   word here or word there over the years since
19   I've produced it but that was an endeavor
20   actually.
21              So, once I -- once I got it down,
22   I have used it to, again, demonstrate to the
23   Court and jury that I have an understanding
0035
 1   of the process of the manufacturing.
 2              I worked a majority of my time in
 3   the tire industry actually in the factories.
 4   That was just a philosophy of Sumitomo that
 5   was the parent company of Dunlop at the time
 6   is very flat organization.
 7              We do have a headquarters in Kobe
 8   but very flat organization.  Put in the en-
 9   gineers in the manufacturing facility so that
10   they're not designing what can't be produced
11   and I -- I see value to that and I also see
12   value to 6,000 people in Akron doing R&D.  I
13   mean, there's -- you can have both but that
14   -- that was --
15         Q.   So my question -- and I think you
16   have answered it -- there is nothing in pages
17   3 through 9 that is specific to this case;
18   correct?
19         A.   No.  I didn't produce it just for
20   this report if that's the question.
21         Q.   Right.
22         A.   I produced that to demonstrate
23   know how about tire manufacturing.
0036
 1         Q.   There's nothing in pages 3 through
 2   9 that is based on any specific evidence in
 3   this case; correct?
 4         A.   I think that's correct.
 5         Q.   All right.  Page 10 of your report
 6   is entitled "Designing a passenger or light
 7   truck steel belted radial tire" and that goes
 8   for it looks like from pages 10 through 15;
 9   right?
10         A.   Yes.
11         Q.   Same questions for this section,
12   is this a section that you use in each of
13   your reports?
14         A.   Generally, yes.
15         Q.   This is something that you drafted
16   at some point in the past and you basically
17   drop it into each report; correct?
18         A.   Yes; again, to show know how for
19   the design approach?
20         Q.   And so is there anything in this
21   section from page 10 through page 15 that is
22   specific to the facts of this case?
23         A.   Not specific to, no, just general
0037
 1   background.
 2         Q.   Is there anything in pages 10
 3   through 15 that is specific to any of the
 4   facts or evidence that's been developed in
 5   this case?
 6         A.   I don't guess I understand the
 7   distinction in your question.
 8         Q.   Let me strike -- let me re-ask it
 9   because I didn't ask what I meant.
10              Are you relying on any evidence in
11   this case for what's been included in section
12   -- pages 10 through 15?
13         A.   I guess I'm still confused at the
14   -- at the question but the best answer I can
15   offer to what I'm under -- trying to under-
16   stand the question to be is:  I'm not going
17   to exclude myself from using anything in the
18   report in support of myself but, if I under-
19   stand the spirit of what you're asking, I
20   think there may be things also offered else-
21   where in the report that I would rely on that
22   -- that touch on some of these things design-
23   wise.
0038
 1              I don't know if I am understanding
 2   your --
 3         Q.   I'm asking a more direct question.
 4   In preparing pages 10 through 15 of the -- of
 5   your report, are you relying on any evidence
 6   that has been developed in this case?
 7         A.   In preparing this, no.  It was
 8   written before this case.
 9         Q.   That was my question.
10         A.   Oh, sorry.
11         Q.   And, for pages 10 through 15, I
12   -- I don't want to make assumptions, that --
13   those -- that section was based on your ex-
14   periences working at Dunlop and Goodyear; is
15   that a fair statement?
16         A.   At least knowledge gained there.
17   Not all just Dunlop experiences but knowledge
18   I gained in that process working, yes.
19         Q.   Page 16 says "Similarities between
20   medium truck tires and passenger/light truck
21   processing designs."
22              Is there anything on this page
23   that is specific to the facts of this case?
0039
 1         A.   Not specific to the specific facts
 2   but in that there is medium truck tire here
 3   in that everything that I talked about prior
 4   to page 16 majored on passenger light truck
 5   discussion.
 6              This page is meant to say:  "And
 7   yet medium trucks while I didn't design those
 8   share very similar components, very similar
 9   processing in the manufacturing of the tire
10   and in the design of the tire.  Maybe more
11   components, a little more robustness, thicker
12   tread and so forth; but, otherwise, they're
13   still steel belted radial tires and they
14   share failure modes that steel belted radial
15   tires experience.
16              So, other than that, not specific
17   to this tire's facts.
18         Q.   Okay.  On page 17, I think this --
19   this is a description of the method that you
20   used; correct?
21         A.   Right.
22         Q.   That's what we were discussing
23   earlier that's reflected in your process and
0040
 1   notes that you took but this is a description
 2   of -- of the -- essentially that process?
 3         A.   And the thought behind the notes,
 4   right, the thought of how am I analyzing as I
 5   go and what am I gleaning from this evidence
 6   individually and independently of other evi-
 7   dence; and then how can I -- as a result of
 8   completing an analysis, how can I come to the
 9   conclusions and it's based on the -- on this
10   process.
11         Q.   So, on your second line here, it
12   says:  "I have confirmed this by meeting and
13   discussing this topic with other tire expert-
14   s" and that's describing your manner of exam-
15   ination.
16              What other tire experts are you
17   referring to?
18         A.   I have spoken to other people at
19   conferences; Dennis Carlton -- Carlson, David
20   Southwell.  I have met with -- the guy's name
21   is not coming to me as I sit here but, early
22   on in the process of deciding about doing
23   this -- this type of consulting work, I met
0041
 1   with a guy in Michigan.  His name is eluding
 2   me at the moment.
 3         Q.   Would that be William Worley?
 4         A.   No.  This guy had already basic-
 5   ly retired but he had a lot of experience in
 6   doing forensics.  He's up in cherry country
 7   up there but I can't think of his name off
 8   the top of my head.  So, anyway, I met with
 9   him.
10              I have met with Worley at other
11   conferences than the ones I was thinking of
12   but -- so I've -- I've discussed with them.
13   I've observed.
14              For example, Mr. Grant in this
15   case, I observed him conducting inspections.
16   We use the same process.  Come to different
17   conclusions on occasions but he uses the same
18   process of documenting and I've seen him on
19   video doing inspections that I wasn't present
20   at.  I've been present in joint inspections.
21              So the methodology is the same.
22   The results obviously may favor, you know,
23   one or the other parties in the case but the
0042
 1   process, scientific process, or approach to
 2   the evidence is the same.
 3         Q.   You mentioned conferences.  Do you
 4   belong to any specific organizations at the
 5   current time?
 6         A.   I'd have to look back and see
 7   whether I've updated.  Some of it's automat-
 8   ically updated and others not.
 9              The Society of Automotive Engin-
10   eers was the last one that I participated in
11   and I may still be a member of.  I don't know
12   if it's an auto update or not.
13         Q.   Okay.  So -- so what -- my -- my
14   question was:  What industry organizations do
15   you belong to?
16         A.   Yeah, I'm just saying I don't know
17   if it's current, my -- if my membership fee
18   is current but Society of Automotive Engin-
19   eers I've been involved in.
20         Q.   Okay.  Anything else?
21         A.   The HIFI organization; Hazard
22   Information Foundation, I have presented at.
23   It's been a few years on that but I can't
0043
 1   think of anything else right now.
 2         Q.   You mentioned conferences.  How
 3   often do you go to industry conferences?
 4         A.   I've been to Society of Automotive
 5   Engineers; and, after that, Tire Society and
 6   others I attended when I was in the industry
 7   but I haven't attended since.
 8         Q.   How about, for example, did you
 9   ever belong to the Rubber Manufacturers
10   Association?
11         A.   The company did but I wasn't a
12   representative.
13         Q.   And how about Tire Manufacturers
14   Association, were you ever involved with
15   them?
16         A.   No.
17         Q.   Okay.  Have you ever attended or
18   presented at the -- at an ITEC Conference?
19         A.   No.
20         Q.   Okay.  Have you ever presented or
21   attended any international tire conferences?
22         A.   No.
23         Q.   I'm going to break this down into
0044
 1   while you were at Goodyear Dunlop and after
 2   with these next few questions.
 3              Have you been involved while you
 4   were at Goodyear Dunlop with any studies on
 5   tire performance; such as, what causes tire
 6   failures in the field?
 7         A.   Studies.  Conducted studies.
 8              When you say the word "studies,"
 9   I'm thinking of bigger classroom settings but
10   I conducted studies, every tire designer did.
11              When we designed a product we were
12   tasked with making sure that it didn't suffer
13   failure in its normal serviceable life and we
14   had internal tests/protocols established for
15   that and we did things like peel back treads
16   looking for liner pattern marks.
17              I noted that Grant mentions he
18   saw some liner pattern marks in some Dunlop
19   tires.  Well, if he did, that's why we were
20   looking.  If we found them, we wanted them
21   out.
22              So, you know, suggesting that that
23   is an okay thing to find is improper based on
0045
 1   my understanding and training in the industry
 2   and specifically in regards to Dunlop, which
 3   he mentions in his report.
 4              So liner pattern tire marks was
 5   something that we didn't want and we would
 6   be instructed every -- in the training pro-
 7   cess and I continued this as I became man-
 8   agement, every new design and new belt pack-
 9   age, new configuration, we peeled the treads
10   back and peeled the belts back and looked for
11   any anomaly that kept there from being proper
12   adhesion amongst the belts and whatever we
13   found we ran it to, showed it to the factory
14   and said "In the case of liner pattern marks,
15   you've got to refresh this material and keep
16   it fresh for the tire builders."
17              In the case of pockets of air or
18   anything like that, then we had to increase
19   the stitcher pressure on the machine to force
20   this air out before you go to cure because
21   you're capturing it in the tire.
22              So, certainly, there were ongoing
23   regular studies on that.  That was part and
0046
 1   parcel of the way I was trained and practices
 2   that I was trained with.
 3              In addition to, if we run an en-
 4   durance test internally and indoor on a, you
 5   know, 67-inch steel drum machine if the tire
 6   fails and it failed prematurely for the mode
 7   that we were putting it through then we diced
 8   the tire back with a band saw looking for the
 9   initiating points and then either looked to
10   see if we had manufacturing issues that were
11   exacerbating that area or if we had a design
12   issue; the belts were off, not to the right
13   dimension or what have you and then we would
14   redesign based on that before we launched the
15   product into the market.
16              So certainly there were studies.
17         Q.   Okay.  Let me ask the question a
18   different way.  On page 46 of your report, it
19   lists your publications and patents.
20         A.   Okay.
21         Q.   It says the statement is dated the
22   22nd of August, 2010.
23         A.   All right.
0047
 1         Q.   So, if I'm reading this correctly,
 2   these were your publications as of that date;
 3   is that correct?
 4         A.   Yes.
 5         Q.   Are there any since that date?
 6         A.   I contributed the section on tire
 7   manufacturing defects to a booklet that the
 8   Beasley Allen Law Firm was putting out on
 9   tire defects.  I don't remember the exact
10   dating of that but it's another section of a
11   publication that I assisted with providing
12   explanation for manufacturing defects and
13   images of those defects.
14         Q.   Other than this publication for
15   the law firm that you mentioned, have you
16   published anything else since August 22nd,
17   2010?
18         A.   Not fully published but I do have
19   some reference materials that I think are
20   already in the referenced CD but also a sort
21   of informal review of -- let me see if I can
22   find it -- defects and conditions that cause
23   or contribute to tread separations.
0048
 1              I sent these out to Dennis Carlson
 2   and Brian Darr and I sent them images -- and
 3   -- and mine are in here.  I sent them a pack-
 4   et of images of conditions of defects -- or
 5   manufacturing defects that I had observed in
 6   various tires that I testified had led to the
 7   tires ultimate tread separation failure; so
 8   trapped air, liner pattern marks, cracked
 9   inner liner splices, porosities so -- so far,
10   oxidation, dog-eared splices, overlapped belt
11   wires, gaps, splices in the belts, scalloped
12   wires in the belts and asked them if they had
13   something similar that they had testified was
14   a contributing factor to a tread separation
15   to present back to me and they did.
16              So while this is informal I under-
17   stand, it's not peer reviewed but these were
18   my peers and so I sent them this packet and
19   they returned two packets to me of "Tire" --
20   Carlson said:  "Tire defects and conditions
21   that caused or contributed to tread belt
22   separations."  Brian Darr, his was covered
23   with a cover sheet:  "Tire Manufacturing
0049
 1   Defects and Deficiencies."
 2              So, to the extent that these are
 3   exerts in the field of tire forensics, I just
 4   wanted to see from a wheelhouse of what they
 5   have seen and tires they have worked on what
 6   kinds of defects were they seeing and were
 7   they in agreement that these things were con-
 8   tributing to tire failures and they produced
 9   that back to me.
10              So that's some of the dialogue in
11   a semiformal peer-reviewed process that I
12   conducted.
13         Q.   Okay.  My question was:  Have you
14   published anything since August 22nd, 2010?
15         A.   Well, I produced it to them.  I
16   didn't -- it's not a publishing in the -- in
17   the normal sense of publishing.
18         Q.   This -- these pictures that you
19   sent to Mr. Carlson and -- what was the name?
20         A.   Brian Darr.
21         Q.   Dower?
22         A.   Darr.
23         Q.   D-a-r-r?
0050
 1         A.   Yes.
 2         Q.   These weren't published in, you
 3   know, for example, an industry trade journal
 4   or a scientific publication or anything like
 5   that; correct?
 6         A.   Not at this point, that's correct.
 7         Q.   It's just something you exchanged
 8   with some people that you've worked with over
 9   the years?
10         A.   Yes.
11         Q.   So the answer to my question then
12   is:  No you have not published anything since
13   August 22nd, 2010?
14         A.   I think that's correct.
15         Q.   Looking at page 18 of your report,
16   "Cottle Inspection Notes," are those the --
17   the things that we talked about from pages 19
18   through 23?
19         A.   Yes.
20         Q.   Is there a separate version of
21   that or is this the only version of it?
22         A.   That's it.
23         Q.   The report is the only version?
0051
 1         A.   Yes.
 2         Q.   The "Cottles File CD's (Subject
 3   Dismount; Tread A X-rays; Right Front Compan-
 4   ion Tire Dismount & Shearography," have those
 5   been produced yet in this case?
 6         A.   They're here.
 7         Q.   Then "Cottles Inspection Photos,"
 8   we've talked about that.
 9         A.   Right.
10         Q.   "Cottles" -- "Cottles Reference
11   Materials," I assume that's the bulk of the
12   remainder of this box?
13         A.   No.  Actually, it's a CD library
14   of materials.
15         Q.   Okay.  And then you have reference
16   here to "Defect OSIs"?
17         A.   Yes.
18         Q.   Is that these pages we were just
19   talking about, the exchange with Carlson and
20   Darr, or is that something else?
21         A.   In addition to that.  These are
22   examples of it but also they are examples I
23   tried to collect for the jury for the Court
0052
 1   to understand that this not the first time I
 2   have see a trapped air impression in a tire.
 3   This is not the first time I've seen liner
 4   pattern marks in a tire and this is not the
 5   first time tires that had tread separation
 6   failures presented oxidation and polishing
 7   within.
 8              At one point in time, Mr. Grant
 9   agreed with me that there was oxidation.  He
10   just thought it got there a different way.
11   Now he doesn't even see it when he is looking
12   at the same evidence.
13              So, at one point in time, we had
14   discussion about the mechanism that got it
15   there.  Now we don't do that but I've got ex-
16   amples of oxidation that's occurring to the
17   belt skim rubber that leads and contributes
18   to the tread separation process.
19              30, 40, 50 cases.  They're not
20   this case specific.  They're not Double Coin
21   specific but they're evidence in other failed
22   tires, including the photographs x-ray report
23   in those files.
0053
 1         Q.   Okay.  So, when you're referring
 2   to these defects, these are from other cases,
 3   other manufacturers, other tires?
 4         A.   Right.
 5         Q.   Or other plaintiffs?  I mean,
 6   everything -- everything is from a different
 7   matter?
 8         A.   That's right, it's drilled into
 9   the defect that's observed in the tire's tac-
10   tile and visual inspections and some -- in
11   some cases x-ray inspections but, for these
12   three, visual.
13              So there are multiple samples of
14   cases and evidence in those from prior cases
15   just to demonstrate to the jury that -- and
16   the judge this is not novel, this is -- and
17   -- and -- and these folders here or -- or the
18   collections here that we've talked about that
19   I exchanged with Carlson and Darr further
20   suggests this is not novel.  These things
21   cause tire failures.
22              If you've been in the industry,
23   you knew to look for them.  In my experience,
0054
 1   I was trained to look for them.
 2              For someone from the industry to
 3   suggest that they don't exist or they don't
 4   matter, well, I wasn't trained that way.  So,
 5   if -- if that's case in Mr. Grant's opinion,
 6   then I didn't -- I wasn't trained that way.
 7   So --
 8         Q.   Okay.  So my question is a simple
 9   one.  Are any of these pictures from this
10   case when you refer to "Defect OSIs"?
11         A.   No.
12         Q.   Then you refer to "Case OSIs" and
13   you refer to "Doty" and "Frisch."
14         A.   Yes.
15         Q.   Those are not in this case either;
16   correct?
17         A.   Not this case but substantially
18   similar identical tires I think based on my
19   understanding of the shared green tires and
20   in support of my opinions because I found
21   similar defects in them.
22         Q.   I see you reference a Protective
23   Order in the case.
0055
 1              Have you signed the Exhibit A to
 2   the Protective Order?
 3         A.   If I had it, I did, yes.
 4              I may have spoken too quickly.  I
 5   don't see an Exhibit A but I've got the Pro-
 6   tective Order.  So I've handled the materials
 7   I've received as if I had signed it.  Whether
 8   I have or not, I don't see that page.
 9              MR. BERGMAN:  We've been going a
10   little over an hour.  Why don't we take a
11   short break?
12              VIDEOGRAPHER:  Off the record at
13   10:08.
14              (Short recess.)
15              VIDEOGRAPHER:  Back on the record
16   at 10:16.
17         Q.   All right.  Mr. Cottles, if you
18   could turn -- you actually had mentioned dur-
19   ing the break you had some further clarifica-
20   tion on some of the questions I had asked you
21   earlier.
22         A.   That's right.  I found the Cover
23   Letters and Communications file.  On January
0056
 1   31st, 2019, I was first contacted I think
 2   about this case, at least that's the closer
 3   date than I can find anywhere else about this
 4   case.
 5         Q.   And so your observations and your
 6   notes related to the subject tire would have
 7   been sometime between the months of February,
 8   March, or early April of 2019?
 9         A.   Ask me that again.
10         Q.   Your notes and observations of the
11   subject tire would've been from sometime in
12   February, March, or April of 2019?
13         A.   That's right.
14         Q.   Let's go ahead and go through your
15   report starting on page 19.  Actually, let me
16   back up.
17              So, in the History section, you
18   list all the documents that you've received
19   and/or reviewed in this case; is that
20   correct?
21         A.   At the time, yes.
22         Q.   What do you mean "at the time"?
23   What have you looked at recently that's not
0057
 1   listed here?
 2         A.   I think I've got depositions of
 3   the corporate reps' deposition, Du, Su, and
 4   Murphy.
 5         Q.   Those are listed here.
 6         A.   Material, the inner liner material
 7   was sent to me.  That's all I can think of.
 8   There may be -- just in case there's other
 9   things, it'll be in the file.
10         Q.   Okay.  Let's talk about the -- the
11   box that you brought with you then.  So, very
12   generally, what are the contents of that box?
13         A.   I've got hard copies of photos.
14   I've got some photos collected and clipped by
15   what I presume might be some of our discus-
16   sion points.
17              I've got -- I've got the -- some
18   hard copies of depositions.  I've also got a
19   thumb drive that's got everything in the file
20   on it I think but I've got hard copies of
21   some of the discovery produced by Bates Num-
22   ber, the specs and the field returns and so
23   forth.
0058
 1              CDs of the reference -- my refer-
 2   ence materials, CDs that I believe have the
 3   accident report and others -- the photos of
 4   others -- that others have produced, my case
 5   photos.
 6              Right front tire's dismount and
 7   shearography results, tread piece A's x-ray
 8   and the subject dismount video in addition to
 9   what I've already pulled out in a folder
10   which included the invoices and the images
11   that were shared earlier we talked about, the
12   Protective Order, Interrogatories, communica-
13   tions, some shipping materials.
14              A report of Corey, a report of
15   Grema (sic), report of Grant, my Duces Tecum,
16   Deposition Testimony History List, my resume,
17   accident report in hard copy, a hard copy of
18   a patent that I rely upon for the nylon opin-
19   ion.  I think that's about it.
20              I have a section of a tire just
21   to demonstrate what trapped air in a tire can
22   look like in the real world and demonstrate
23   to the jury.  It's not a Double Coin tire,
0059
 1   it's a light truck tire but just an example
 2   of how that gets captured.  I think that's
 3   it.
 4         Q.   Regarding the pictures, you said
 5   you have them clipped in a specific way.
 6              Are they available electronically
 7   that way as well or -- or, in other words, is
 8   this the only way that these -- these current
 9   groupings of pictures, is the only evidence
10   of it right now are on that flash drive?  Are
11   the pictures grouped in the same way?
12         A.   They're not grouped on the flash
13   drive, no.  I just collected them from the
14   hard copies.
15         Q.   And these pictures, are they
16   labeled in any fashion for identification?
17         A.   No, the -- they don't even do that
18   now.  I was just looking on the back of them.
19   I get them printed at Walgreen's in Athens,
20   Alabama and they used to have a Walgreen's
21   serial on them but they don't have that.
22              So there's -- there's -- there's
23   nothing on the picture itself that does that.
0060
 1   These are just representatives out of the
 2   total for different things; oxidation, liner
 3   pattern marks, trapped air impressions, other
 4   conditions.
 5              So what we usually do is make them
 6   a composite exhibit out of the stack and then
 7   the court reporter can copy them.
 8         Q.   So, with respect to your report,
 9   have you done that already in the report at
10   -- somewhere?
11         A.   Done what?
12         Q.   Identified the pictures that you
13   rely upon in reaching your -- your opinions
14   or conclusions.
15         A.   No.  I mean, they're part of the
16   total collection of pictures I've produced
17   but I haven't segregated them in the report,
18   no.
19         Q.   Okay.  And the was my question.
20              So, as we're going through each
21   of the sections in your report, there -- you
22   have not identified any specific pictures for
23   any of those sections of your report --
0061
 1         A.   Correct.
 2         Q.   -- with your analysis?
 3         A.   Sorry.  Correct.
 4         Q.   Let's go to -- turn to your report
 5   for the moment.  So, going through your notes
 6   and observations of the tire, starting with
 7   the serial side markings, you note "Although
 8   the markings were burned away."
 9              Did you do any kind of investiga-
10   tion or analysis into what caused the tire to
11   burn?
12         A.   Not specific as to cause of burn.
13   I've certainly seen multiple tires burn in
14   tread separation cases but I did in my report
15   eliminate some things that according to your
16   experts they rely upon to come to the condi-
17   tion that they suggest caused the burn.
18              So, in that way, I think I have
19   eliminated some things already in my report
20   that -- for example, I think one of them men-
21   tions underinflation operation causing bluing
22   and heating of the tire and so forth and I --
23   I don't -- I've eliminated in my analysis
0062
 1   underinflated operation.
 2              I didn't specifically describe how
 3   the fire occurred but I've eliminated that
 4   causal link in my review of the tire evidence
 5   itself.
 6         Q.   My question wasn't about what you
 7   read in others' reports.  My question was:
 8   What investigation did you do into the cause
 9   of the burning?
10         A.   Again, other than seeing it multi-
11   ple times, I haven't analyzed this burn.
12              I mean, my testimony was just that
13   looking at those reports I've seen nothing
14   that indicates the tire operated in an under-
15   inflated method.
16         Q.   Did you do any investigation into
17   any mechanical conditions on the truck?
18         A.   No.
19         Q.   Did you do any investigation to
20   determine when the tire started burning?
21         A.   No, other than it's obvious and I
22   think your expert -- tire expert agrees with
23   me that the tread separated before the tire
0063
 1   burned because it doesn't share that damage.
 2         Q.   Did you know when this tire was
 3   manufactured?
 4         A.   Not specifically because that area
 5   of the tire is burned but I believe that the
 6   parties -- according to the items I reviewed,
 7   I believe the parties are in agreement that
 8   it is likely in the 2016 timeframe.
 9         Q.   Have you done any investigation as
10   to when this tire was manufactured?
11         A.   Not -- not other than what I just
12   said because the tire doesn't show it itself.
13         Q.   Have you done any investigation
14   into where this tire was manufactured?
15         A.   I understand the two locations for
16   the potential of the tire were the Shanghai
17   factory or the -- I can't pronounce it -- but
18   the other Chinese factory it was produced in
19   at the time.
20         Q.   Have you done any investigation
21   into where the tire was manufactured?
22         A.   No.  I'm just relying on the in-
23   formation in the file.  I haven't individual-
0064
 1   ly sought to figure out how and where the
 2   tire could be produced.
 3         Q.   Do you have any information as to
 4   when the tire was installed on the vehicle in
 5   question?
 6         A.   Looking at Kent -- Bates Numbers
 7   Kent 1454 and 1455, it demonstrates two steer
 8   tires were installed.  It looks like the date
 9   is 9/29/2017.
10              I think that was the -- again, I
11   don't think that's in contention among the
12   parties as I -- as far as I understand it.
13         Q.   And do you know how many miles the
14   tire was driven before the accident occurred?
15         A.   My recollection was something on
16   the order of about 36,000 miles.
17         Q.   Looking at your notes on the SS
18   marking side, there's not many.  On the SOS
19   marking side, you note a few.
20              You have "65R 22.5" and question
21   marks in parentheses.  What is that referring
22   to?
23         A.   I think the legibility of the 65R
0065
 1   22.5 portion of that but it was a 385 and
 2   consistent with the other side.
 3         Q.   What do the initials "LRL" refer
 4   to?
 5         A.   Load Range L.
 6         Q.   Do you know how much weight the
 7   truck was carrying the day of the accident?
 8         A.   Yeah, I don't know that I recall
 9   that off the top of my head.  I understand it
10   was a sand load but I don't know how much.
11         Q.   And your notes here indicate a
12   "CCCsF0000268."  Do you know what that refers
13   to?
14         A.   Yes.  That's a certification for
15   China, equivalent or their version of a DOT
16   but not the DOT.
17         Q.   So then beginning on page 21 you
18   have some of your tread carcass inspections.
19         A.   Yes.
20         Q.   It says:  "0 degrees, #1 and #2
21   belts are attached with strips of #3 and #4
22   belts attached to #2 belt."
23              Do you have any photographs of
0066
 1   that?
 2         A.   Yes.  They're not segregated so it
 3   is going to be a process.
 4              These may not be exhaustive be-
 5   cause these were shuffled around in four
 6   boxes but I think this is indicating what I
 7   was talking about.
 8         Q.   Okay.  Is there anything on these
 9   pictures that tells us that this the date
10   these were taken or the tire -- which tire
11   this was?
12         A.   Not on the hard copies but you
13   have the CD here that can be copied and you
14   can see when I took the photograph and it'll
15   be a sequence of photographs much like we've
16   talked about in the inspection process to
17   determine this is the failed tire, not the
18   companion tire.
19         Q.   So let's go ahead and have these
20   marked as Exhibit 2.
21              (Defendant's Exhibit Number 2 was
22   marked for identification.)
23         A.   You're going to call this Exhibit
0067
 1   2?
 2         Q.   Yes.
 3              Going down about halfway, it says:
 4   "Chip and tear noted in tread with multiple
 5   deep gouges."
 6              What are you referring to there?
 7         A.   Conditions on the tread surface of
 8   the tire that obviously was used in the fore-
 9   seeable area of off-road use or gravel-pit
10   use or what have you to cause chips and tears
11   to the tread.
12         Q.   And then "multiple deep gouges,"
13   are you talking about like parts of the tread
14   kind of cut away or are you talking about --
15   when you say "gouges," what are you referring
16   to?
17         A.   Cuts into the tread at least and
18   maybe -- I said "the chip."  That's usually
19   the tearaway.
20         Q.   Going down, you have -- it refers
21   to "275-300 degrees serial side," "300-310
22   degrees serial side;" and then it says "310-
23   330 degrees CL."
0068
 1              What does "CL" refer to?
 2         A.   Center line.
 3         Q.   You claim 275-300 degrees serial
 4   side is trapped air channel on the #2 belt
 5   wedge.
 6              Do you have pictures of that?
 7         A.   We have pictures of the trapped
 8   air found.  I won't say that I've segregated
 9   it by degree location because that reference
10   isn't in the shot but going through the CD
11   version of the photos should help do that
12   showing where I am by degree rotation of the
13   tire as I'm doing the inspection but I have
14   some samples of trapped air at the belt edge
15   area that -- there's several here that -- I
16   pulled some there off the top to show.
17         Q.   So, again, with these pictures,
18   there's nothing on the picture that tells me
19   where on the tire this picture was taken;
20   correct?
21         A.   Yeah, on the hard copy, that's not
22   -- that's correct.
23         Q.   When you say that it's on the CD
0069
 1   you can figure it out, you know, how can I
 2   figure it out from the CD?
 3         A.   So, as we've talked, I go through
 4   a process in -- in how I sequence what I'm
 5   looking at and when I'm looking at it and
 6   what degrees I start and so forth.
 7              I -- I think that that gets us a
 8   lot closer than just the hard copy but just
 9   to show you a representative image I printed
10   those.
11         Q.   So let's go ahead and mark this
12   block as Cottles Exhibit 3.  Oh, just the
13   ones you pulled out.
14              (Defendant's Exhibit Number 3 was
15   marked for identification.)
16         A.   Well, they're all -- they all have
17   some distance or closer images of basically
18   the same areas.  So I don't know about -- if
19   I can get it right back to what you had when
20   you were looking or not.
21         Q.   And then you said you see some
22   liner pattern marks on the #2 belt skim 330-
23   370 degrees to center line.
0070
 1              What pictures do you have of that?
 2         A.   I've got a collection of liner
 3   imprints but I mention liner again on page 22
 4   and they're not segregated from each other
 5   and they're sort of zoomed in.  I don't know
 6   that I can do that in that shot but that's
 7   the collection of liner imprints.
 8         Q.   Have you done any measurement as
 9   to the width of these liner imprints, the
10   thickness of them?
11         A.   I haven't.
12         Q.   And, again, with these pictures,
13   there's nothing on these pictures that tells
14   me where on the tire each of these pictures
15   was taken; correct?
16         A.   Not on the hard copy, that's
17   correct.
18         Q.   That will be Cottles Exhibit 4.
19              On the tread piece, you talk about
20   some polishing between 1 and 2 belts.
21              Do you have photographs of that?
22              (Defendant's Exhibit Number 4 was
23   marked for identification.
0071
 1         A.   (Witness hands over pictures.)
 2         Q.   Let's go ahead and mark this as
 3   Cottles Exhibit 5 I think we're up to.
 4              Next, there's a reference to major
 5   crescent shaped zone of oxidation and polish-
 6   ing exposing bare brassy wires on the tread
 7   piece.
 8              What pictures do you have of that?
 9              (Defendant's Exhibit Number 5 was
10   marked for identification.)
11         A.   (Witness hands over pictures.)
12         Q.   Let's go ahead and mark those as
13   Cottles Exhibit 6.
14              And then you have a couple of
15   other stacks here.  What are those stacks of
16   pictures referring to?
17              (Defendant's Exhibit Number 6 was
18   marked for identification.)
19         A.   This stack of 1, 2, 3, 5 I think
20   -- 6 shots shows the crescent shaped zone of
21   oxidation that's occurring under the tread
22   piece and I noted in my notes I noticed that
23   Mr. Grant said I didn't appear to know where
0072
 1   the tire separated from but this is the major
 2   crescent shaped zone.
 3              That's where the majority of the
 4   oxidation is going from not only the belt
 5   edge but migrating across the face of the
 6   tire and, when the adhesion level gets low
 7   enough, the tread separates.
 8              So it's sort of obvious but he
 9   didn't -- he didn't see it.
10         Q.   This will be Cottles 7.
11              Then the other two stacks that you
12   have are the ones that you have previously
13   grouped?
14              (Defendant's Exhibit Number 7 was
15   marked for identification.)
16         A.   This is a couple of images, three
17   images of localized punctures through the
18   tread causing small localized rust spots in
19   the tire and not the location of the major
20   crescent shaped zone of oxidation and polish-
21   ing.
22              So they're individually happening
23   in the tire but they're not the contributing
0073
 1   factor to the major crescent shaped zone at
 2   separation location.
 3         Q.   This will be Cottles Exhibit 8.
 4              And then the other two stacks, or
 5   other stack?
 6              (Defendant's Exhibit Number 8 was
 7   marked for identification.)
 8         A.   This is just a series of the pho-
 9   tos looking at the side of the tire where
10   there's inner liner left where there's not --
11   there's reports that suggest that there's a
12   repair patch in the tire.  I didn't see it
13   and Joe Grant didn't see it, your tire expert
14   but there's some discussion about losing a
15   repair patch.  I think that's speculative.
16   There's -- there's no evidence of a repair
17   patch that I see and I looked through Grant's
18   report and he didn't see it either.
19              So there some discussion of that.
20   I just collected the photos to show I don't
21   see a repair patch in the tire.
22              Are you --
23         Q.   No, I'm not going to mark that.
0074
 1         A.   Those are my favorite ones.
 2         Q.   It would probably turn the report
 3   into a 3 gigabyte monstrosity.
 4              You -- on page 22, you have tread
 5   depth notes?
 6         A.   Yes.
 7         Q.   Was the tread depth consistent
 8   with the mileage you believe was on the tire?
 9         A.   I believe so, yes, for the appli-
10   cation.
11         Q.   What about the variation of the
12   tread depths.  Did that indicate anything to
13   you?
14         A.   Obviously, the tire operates under
15   heavy loads and steering with loads on the
16   vehicle.  I don't think it points out any
17   particular thing.  It's fairly random across.
18              I'm seeing at some points 5.3 in
19   the center up to 9.5 in the center.  I think
20   this is what you see in heavy duty truck use.
21         Q.   Are you saying it's consistent as
22   well as the outer side being 2, 3 -- 2, 3,
23   4/32nds lower than the inner sections?
0075
 1         A.   These are millimeters, not 32nds.
 2         Q.   Millimeters?  Okay.
 3         A.   Yeah.  So there's some variation
 4   but again these are front steer tires, you're
 5   going to scrub shoulders and it's an applica-
 6   tion in which they're often on underdeveloped
 7   surfaces obviously.
 8         Q.   You said you had some x-rays done
 9   of the tread piece; right?
10         A.   Yes.
11         Q.   Do you have those pictures?
12         A.   (Witness hands over pictures.)
13         Q.   Did you x-ray this entire tread?
14         A.   No, just the tread piece.
15         Q.   I'm sorry.  The entire tread
16   piece, did you x-ray the entirety of the
17   tread piece?
18         A.   Yes.
19         Q.   Let's mark that as Exhibit 9.
20              Looking at page 29, your Analysis,
21   you first observation, as you call, it says:
22   "The presence of premature oxidative degrad-
23   ation on the belt skims."
0076
 1              At the end you're talking about --
 2   it says:  "This constitutes a defect in the
 3   subject tire which caused or contributed to
 4   cause this tire to fail."
 5              Are you saying that the oxidation
 6   -- the degradation was a cause of the failure
 7   of the tire?
 8              (Defendant's Exhibit Number 9 was
 9   marked for identification.)
10         A.   Yes.
11         Q.   Okay.  And how did the oxidative
12   degradation cause the tire to fail?
13         A.   Well, in two ways.  The oxidation
14   occurring within the tire becomes the mechan-
15   ism or the rubber to let loose from itself
16   because -- and for the purposes of the jury
17   who have probably never talked about a tire
18   before, there's no glue in the tire.  It's
19   all bonded together one sheet of rubber over
20   another sheet of rubber until -- and they're
21   all placed on top of each other, inner liner,
22   body ply, belts, tread, sidewall, beads all
23   put into the tire and the rubber has to be
0077
 1   chemically close enough in relation to the
 2   other components that it could have an equal
 3   bond in those location.
 4              And, when oxidation occurs through
 5   whatever means, when it occurs progressively
 6   enough inside the tire that the belts degrade
 7   and start cracking -- the belt rubber, not
 8   the wire -- and the -- the rubber that binds
 9   the wires into the rest of the tire start
10   cracking and then they start propagating that
11   cracking as they lift from each other centri-
12   fugally around the tire as the tire's handl-
13   ing the vehicle load and being cycled on the
14   road.
15              As it comes in -- as any spot
16   comes in contact with the road and compresses
17   you get these microcompressions going on at
18   the belt edge and then, as that oxidation
19   attacks the belt edge area and progresses
20   cracking further around the tire and then
21   starting to migrate across the tire, this
22   gets larger and larger and centrifugally the
23   tire is trying to sling the tread as -- as
0078
 1   it beginning that separation process and the
 2   mechanism for it to do that is the oxidation
 3   occurring across the face of the -- between
 4   the belts that are bonded together.
 5              In this case, there are four steel
 6   belts and the two belts that we are talking
 7   about are the second and third belt.  Those
 8   are called the operating belts in a four-belt
 9   system.  So the separation commences between
10   the two belts and migrate across until it's
11   so severe that the top #3 belt and the #4
12   belt and the tread can't hold on centrifugal-
13   ly to the lower.  The adhesion is too low and
14   so it breaks loose and peels off.  So that's
15   how it affects it.
16              You don't want so much oxidation
17   between belts that this tire which is market-
18   ed and developed to be the kind of tire that
19   wears out a full tread and then can be re-
20   placed with two retreads.  It should be able
21   to hold all those belts together so that you
22   get the two additional retread lives of it,
23   which your experts called "the million mile
0079
 1   carcass" with this kind of medium truck tire.
 2              So you certainly expect more than
 3   36,000 in one tread, in some portion of one
 4   tread before you might lose the belt bond and
 5   so that's what happened here and that's how
 6   oxidation con -- connects to it.
 7         Q.   So are you saying that the -- you
 8   said that as the 2 and 3 belt -- you said, as
 9   they started to separate, the tire was liter-
10   ally trying to throw it off?  Is that what
11   you were trying to say?
12         A.   Centrifugally that's what happened
13   the forces are operating away from the spin-
14   dle of the wheel.
15              So, as I get belt edge separation
16   and you've got two belts and the #2 is the
17   widest and the #3 is inset from it and those
18   two belts are working like this on the edge
19   and that working progresses until it's hap-
20   pening farther and farther around the tire
21   but also deeper and deeper within the tire
22   until the belt edge is doing this kind of
23   motion every cycle and, for a tire this size
0080
 1   at highway speed, that can be 15 to 16 times
 2   per second.
 3              So we're working this tire a lot
 4   in that area and I've shown the images of the
 5   polishing that was occurring because those
 6   two belts had separated from each other, they
 7   are polishing the rubber away.
 8              In fact, when I said "brassy wire"
 9   there's no rubber over that wire anymore.  It
10   has been brushing inside the tire through the
11   microcompression and now not so micro, you're
12   getting larger and larger movement as the
13   major crescent shaped zone migrates from one
14   belt edge over toward the other belt edge and
15   we get an area that just doesn't have enough
16   local -- what's the word I want to use --
17   doesn't have enough surface area connection
18   to hold that whole belt system down when all
19   that's attaching to is over here on one loc
20   -- location now and this is all moving in the
21   process (demonstrating.)
22              Often what happens as that occurs
23   is dynamically the tire domes and comes out
0081
 1   around, which is one basis for the interest
 2   in the field results of this tire.  There are
 3   a lot of outer rounds and the testimony is
 4   it's 80 percent of the returns.
 5              So there's a lot of issues going
 6   on with outer round issue where the tires go
 7   more egg shaped that round and that can be a
 8   precursor to this very separation before the
 9   tread actually breaks and peels.
10         Q.   Did you say 15 to 16 times per
11   second?
12         A.   Yes, at highway speeds.
13         Q.   Let me try to unpack that.  That's
14   why I became a lawyer, not a scientist.
15              When you're referring to this 15
16   or 16 times per second, are you refer to
17   revolution or are you referring to something
18   else?
19         A.   Revolutions.  If I put a -- if I
20   had a whole tire here -- and I'll use this
21   section because I can manage that.  If I put
22   an "X" right there, every time the tire ro-
23   tates into contact with the road, there's
0082
 1   compression going on.
 2              The highest stress and strain in
 3   any tire is along the sidewall and at the
 4   belt edge.  Unfortunately, it's a belt edge
 5   because everything else is cinched down in
 6   the tire but the belts are cut and placed on
 7   top of this donut and so now -- now you are
 8   applying stresses and strains at an area that
 9   is a cut surface laying on top of a round
10   tied-in donut of -- with the belt -- the bead
11   cables down here and the body ply wrapped
12   around it, the sidewalls on that; and now
13   I've laid belt material and you've done it
14   four times.
15              And then you put the tread down
16   and every time the tire rotates in contact
17   with the road there's a compression down with
18   the force that's on the tire that's being
19   transmitted from the vehicle to the rim to
20   the tire on the ground and immediately when
21   -- if I put an "X" on that tread, immediately
22   when that X comes into contact with the road
23   everything rebounds and then we do it again,
0083
 1   compress and rebound.
 2              At the same time as the separation
 3   are growing centrifugally all that rotation
 4   on the road is driving the tire -- trying to
 5   drive the tire apart and it's up to how well
 6   adhered all the components are in the tire
 7   whether it maintains its centrality and can
 8   continue to operate and have durability.
 9              When it loses that and becomes egg
10   shaped and begins to peel the tread, it's too
11   late and certainly that carcass can't be used
12   because you split -- you split right between
13   the belts.  You can't use it to retread again
14   even if it didn't rupture in the process,
15   which it almost always does.
16         Q.   What is the circumference of this
17   tire?
18         A.   I give the static -- let me get
19   the right one.  Static loaded radius at 19.4
20   inches.  So that's loaded radius, which means
21   underload deflected, so times 2, so it's 38.8
22   inches.
23              That's reasonable because a tire
0084
 1   standing is about 3 feet tall, a little more
 2   than that.
 3         Q.   Okay.  So about 38 inches you said
 4   is the circumference?
 5         A.   That's the diameter, so times pi.
 6         Q.   So 3.14 times 3 would be, what 9
 7   feet give or take?
 8         A.   Yes.
 9         Q.   Approximately?
10         A.   Yes.
11         Q.   Okay.  And you're saying that
12   that's going around 9 feet 15 to 16 times per
13   second?
14         A.   At highway speeds.  Not at every
15   speed but at highway speed something like
16   that.
17              I haven't calculated it specific-
18   ally for this size but I -- it can be done.
19   I haven't done that.
20              I do look at those numbers in --
21   in the past and it's in the -- it's on the
22   ballpark of that.  It might be 12 revolutions
23   per second or it might be 16 but some -- some
0085
 1   place in there.
 2              I haven't calculated it for this
 3   particular space but in your specs you say
 4   you get 495 revolutions in a mile.  So that's
 5   just that 9 feet rolling out 5,280 feet.
 6         Q.   So it's a little higher than 9
 7   feet if it's -- how much does is say per
 8   mile?
 9         A.   495 revolutions in a mile.
10         Q.   Okay.
11         A.   But, you know, how many revolu-
12   how many revolutions are you getting at high-
13   way speed is -- you're still going to get the
14   same revolutions, you're just going to get
15   there faster; right, than less than a mile
16   necessarily.
17         Q.   Well, sure.  So, if you're going
18   60 miles an hour, that means you're going a
19   mile a minute; right?
20         A.   Right.
21         Q.   There's 60 seconds in a minute.
22         A.   Right.
23         Q.   You're saying 15 or 16 revolutions
0086
 1   per second, that would be 900 revolutions in
 2   play.
 3         A.   So maybe half that then.
 4         Q.   And so in your report you say:
 5   "It constitutes a defect in the subject tire
 6   which caused or contributed to cause the tire
 7   failure."
 8              Was it a cause of the tire fail-
 9   ure, yes or no?
10         A.   Yes.
11         Q.   And where did the tire fail, at
12   what location?
13         A.   In the area of the major crescent
14   shaped zone 90 degrees to -- 90 degrees to
15   175 degrees on the serial opposite shoulder.
16         Q.   The failure didn't start -- so
17   that's about a fourth of the tire; right, 90
18   to 180 degrees?
19         A.   Right.
20         Q.   Where did the actual separation
21   occur?  I occurs in a more specific spot;
22   right?  It didn't occur across a fourth of
23   the tire.
0087
 1         A.   Let me see my exhibits back.
 2              The line on Exhibit 7 and one of
 3   the images from there, which I have actually
 4   in a little better blowup in another couple
 5   of shots but I don't want to get these all
 6   confused.
 7              This polishing that's going on out
 8   at the end of the tread piece and it's pol-
 9   ishing down and shining along long strips of
10   these underlying belts is probably where the
11   initiation of the separation was and where it
12   actually begins to lift first along that
13   diagonal there (indicating.)
14         Q.   And what position on the tire is
15   that?
16         A.   This is off the tread piece.  So
17   Tread Piece A ranges from 275 to 150 on the
18   SS and 315 -- 355, sorry, to 175 on the SOS.
19   I believe I'm looking at the opposite side,
20   the 355 to 175 in that image.
21         Q.   Okay.  And I want to make sure I'm
22   understanding your notes.
23              When it says "355 to 175," that
0088
 1   means that the piece ranged from 175 degrees
 2   opposite side to 355 opposite side; correct?
 3         A.   Right.
 4         Q.   Okay.  And so the piece that --
 5   where you're saying it started, you're saying
 6   it started at 355 or 175, you just don't know
 7   which one?  Is that what you're saying?
 8         A.   No.  It -- so what I'm defining in
 9   this range on page 21 is the SS side 275 to
10   150.  That's -- that's the whole edge, how
11   far that edge goes, 275 to 150.
12         Q.   Correct.
13         A.   And then, on the serial opposite
14   side, 355 back in the shot, back beyond this
15   shot to the 175.
16              So this is the 150-175 range, so
17   in that area of the tread end.
18         Q.   And that's where you're saying it
19   started?
20         A.   Yes.
21              THE WITNESS:  Can we take 5?
22              MR. BERGMAN:  Yeah, we can take a
23   break.
0089
 1              VIDEOGRAPHER:  Off the record at
 2   11:17.
 3              (Short recess.)
 4              VIDEOGRAPHER:  Back on the record
 5   at 11:29.
 6         Q.   Okay.  Mr. Cottles, before we took
 7   a break, we were talking about your first an-
 8   alysis and that was about premature oxidative
 9   degradation.
10         A.   Right.
11         Q.   So let's go into your second one
12   now.
13              Actually, first, you then list a
14   number of different I guess papers and other
15   things you rely upon in support of that
16   opinion; is that correct?
17         A.   That's correct.
18         Q.   Then in here you're talking -- in
19   your third to last bullet point, you acknow-
20   ledge that "All tires experience oxidation;"
21   correct?
22         A.   Can to some degree.  It's the
23   issue of degree that becomes a concern.
0090
 1         Q.   Okay.  Well, in fact, all tires
 2   experience oxidation; right?  That -- that's
 3   just part of the natural process.
 4         A.   Well, externally.
 5              Internally, where rubber is sup-
 6   posed to be protected from it, it should be a
 7   slower process and, in the case of a retread-
 8   able tire, you don't want the process to in-
 9   vade the belting because then you can't re-
10   tread it.
11         Q.   Okay.  You say that there are two
12   factors you look at.  "The oxidational break-
13   down of the rubber occurred before the tires
14   natural life expired;" and two, "There was no
15   other avenue for the air and the moisture to
16   enter the tire."
17              What would be other avenues that
18   you're referring to there?
19         A.   I'm catching up to where you were
20   reading.  Just a minute.
21              This is a discussion about the
22   premature aspect of the oxidation.  If I'm
23   looking at a 25-year-old passenger tire and
0091
 1   it looks internally like -- when it separates
 2   like a 25-year-old passenger tire, it's not
 3   easy to suggest that that rubber shouldn't
 4   look that way if it's oxidized and has been
 5   mounted and inflated and it's been oxidizing
 6   like that.
 7              This is an instance though where
 8   "premature" is an important word because yes,
 9   there's oxidation; but no, you don't want it
10   to the degree that you've got it in the tire
11   because now this tire suffers not just third
12   of its life, less than a third based on tread
13   depth, you didn't get through the first tread
14   no matter how old the tire was.
15              There's no age limit on medium
16   truck tires.  No manufacturer has one and so
17   you're expecting this carcass to survive, you
18   know, the million mile carcass if you want to
19   call it that but it has to be able to be re-
20   treaded with the belts staying bonded to each
21   other so that that -- it can have a second
22   life or third life.  So I'm explaining the
23   premature aspect.
0092
 1              So some things occurring in time,
 2   you know, for a long enough period of time, I
 3   would say it's oxidized as it would naturally
 4   do but this is happening much more rapidly
 5   than it would naturally do based on its
 6   intended foreseeable service in life.
 7         Q.   Okay.  That wasn't my question.
 8              My question -- "There are no other
 9   avenues for the air and moisture to enter the
10   tire."  What are some of the other avenues
11   for air or moisture to enter a tire that you
12   are referring to there?
13         A.   Oh, I see.  If there had been a --
14   a poor seal to the rim; if there had been a,
15   you know, a leaky repair, none of which we
16   have evidence of in this case even though the
17   reports suggest otherwise in one instance.
18              Those are possibilities; but, if
19   the air is pressurized on the inside it's
20   very difficult for it to migrate from outside
21   in.  That's not the tendency of a pressurized
22   tire, to allow -- if you've got a tire in-
23   flated, you know, with 100 plus PSI, air is
0093
 1   not trying to get into the tire against the
 2   pressurized vessel.  It's trying to work its
 3   way through and out and that's where the
 4   oxidation is coming from in this matter.
 5         Q.   So number -- number 2, and you're
 6   citing to tire litigation; but "There was no
 7   other avenue for the air and moisture to en-
 8   ter the tire."
 9              So, if there was a puncture hole,
10   obviously air and moisture would enter the
11   tire through a puncture hole; correct?
12         A.   Not obviously.  It can do.  It's
13   not obvious that it will do because the rub-
14   ber often -- if the puncturing item comes out
15   the rubber seals -- closes back -- not seal
16   but closes back and doesn't allow -- you know
17   the atmosphere is not trying to work its way
18   into the tire.  The tire's pressure is trying
19   to work its way to the atmosphere.  I mean,
20   that' just the basic science of it.
21         Q.   Okay.
22         A.   But I did show you that there are
23   some localized areas in -- in Exhibit 8, okay
0094
 1   Exhibit 8, some localized areas that have
 2   some corrosion going on around a puncture
 3   spot local to -- in the tire but that's
 4   pretty panned in.
 5              If you pan out in the photograph
 6   -- in the area of this, that -- one, that's
 7   not the major crescent shaped zone of oxida-
 8   tion at all.
 9              Two, that's rust on top of rubber
10   that's not affected, polished, oxidized like
11   we see in the failure mode.
12              So can you locally corrode the
13   wire, yeah; but in today's technology with
14   the belt wire provided to the world's indus-
15   try -- tire industry, the problem of a pipet
16   conduit that used to occur in the cabling
17   where there could be a certain number of ca-
18   bles and if you cut across and then looked at
19   them on end point there was a channel in the
20   middle so that if I punctured on this side I
21   rusted on that side doesn't exist anymore.
22              So that's old technology thinking
23   and, if I found it in this tire, I would be
0095
 1   super critical of the fact that somehow one
 2   manufacturer, Double Coin, was able to get
 3   someone convinced to make wire that no one
 4   else is supplying any longer.  That's been
 5   eradicated back in the '80s.
 6              Of course, that brings up a point.
 7   This tire's design is from the '80s, as I
 8   understand the testimony of Mr. Su; and, if
 9   for some reason they were able to use the
10   kind of cabling that doesn't impregnate with
11   rubber in the belt skim (inaudible) process,
12   I'd be very critical of that and I'd like to
13   know a little more about the technology that
14   is currently in the tire based on his testi-
15   mony.
16         Q.   You didn't see any observations of
17   this older wire that you're talking about,
18   did you?
19         A.   No, but there's -- you know, it's
20   often used by Mr. Grant as a testimony that,
21   if I puncture here, I rust over there; and
22   that's not what happens in today's tires.
23              I'm just saying this particular --
0096
 1   that was the '80s technology belting and that
 2   was eliminated in the industry as far as I
 3   know when I first came in the industry 1988;
 4   but it brings up the point that, as I under-
 5   stand Mr. Su's testimony, the technology used
 6   for this tire is virtually the same as it was
 7   when it purchased by Firestone.
 8              I don't know what all technology
 9   was included but, if that was included, I'd
10   like to see the detail of -- if they're still
11   using it or not.
12              And a second thing, we're talking
13   about what other avenues oxidation gets into
14   the tire.  It's my understanding just as a
15   general premise that, when Bridgestone bought
16   Firestone in '88 and then this arrangement
17   with Double Coin and Firestone happened in
18   '89, I don't -- it would be very surprising
19   to me if Bridgestone allowed current technol-
20   ogy to be sold to a competitor.
21              That being said, I think Bridge-
22   stone uses 100 parts halobutyl and bromobutyl
23   style inner liner rubber.  I'm very interest-
0097
 1   ed to know what halobutyl content and type of
 2   butyl is used in the subject tire if that's
 3   produced.
 4              I don't see how it could be a
 5   trade secret because it was not Double Coin's
 6   to begin with but it was sold to them; but,
 7   if that was produced and could be produced,
 8   I'd like to evaluate whether the inner liner
 9   contributed in this case.
10              Grant says it's -- I don't know
11   how he came to this conclusion just looking
12   at a burned inner liner.  He says it's the
13   same kind of inner liner everyone else uses
14   but that's literally probably not true based
15   on the 1980's spectra of the material and --
16   and technology being sold to Double Coin.
17              I'd like to see what the halobutyl
18   content is.  I think that could potentially
19   lead to support for the opinions of the oxi-
20   dation and maybe even an additional opinion
21   based on it.  So I'd -- I'd certainly like
22   to see that information.  I hope it can be
23   produced.
0098
 1         Q.   Did you do any analysis of the
 2   inner liner as part of your inspection?
 3         A.   I haven't without seeking -- seek-
 4   ing court order and that kind of thing.  It
 5   can -- it can be done.
 6              This particular tire's inner liner
 7   is affected enough by the burning that occur-
 8   red that I don't know if I'd want to use this
 9   particular tire, maybe some other sample tire
10   from the -- from -- from the ear but -- if it
11   could be produced but I --
12         Q.   Did you use the companion tire to
13   look at the inner liner?
14              COURT REPORTER:  I didn't hear
15   you.
16         Q.   Did you look at the companion tire
17   to look at inner liner specifications?
18         A.   Specifications as far as retire
19   spec I -- I've studied that for the subject
20   tire.  As far as cured spec and properties,
21   no, I haven't -- I haven't taken a sample
22   from it.
23         Q.   So -- so punctures one way that
0099
 1   air and moisture can get into a tire;
 2   correct?
 3         A.   Into portions of it.  Now, if it
 4   go all -- if it goes all the way through the
 5   inner liner, then obviously air is coming out
 6   and not going in but -- because of the pres-
 7   surization of the tire period.
 8         Q.   How many punctures were on the
 9   tread piece that you noticed?
10         A.   Quite a few.  I didn't -- I didn't
11   count them all but quite a few.
12         Q.   And did you note where they were
13   located on the tread piece?
14         A.   To some degree.  I -- you have my
15   photographs.  So I can point to it in the
16   photographic evidence but I made comment to
17   some of them and then I made sort of a group
18   comment.  "Several punctures and abrasions
19   through tread and stone embedments through-
20   out the tread and the carcass noted."
21         Q.   Were there any portions of the
22   tread that had complete punctures all the way
23   through all four liners or all -- all four
0100
 1   steel belts?
 2         A.   I don't recall seeing one through
 3   all -- all four steel belts.
 4              I saw them in my notes because I
 5   investigated that potential through the third
 6   belt into the second belt.  I don't see that
 7   I made any comment with what was available to
 8   us that something went all the way through.
 9         Q.   Did the x-ray show any punctures
10   all the way through all four belts?
11         A.   Not in any spot that I'm seeing.
12   There was a belt -- at least a belt covering
13   drill holes and puncture holes in every shot
14   I have of the tread piece itself, at least
15   one, sometimes more than one; but, where I
16   have a complete hole, I'm looking at third
17   and fourth belt but there's no second belt in
18   that area.
19              So not in any of the x-rays that I
20   have.
21         Q.   Any other ways air and moisture
22   can get into a tire?
23         A.   Permeation through the inner lin-
0101
 1   er.  I don't know if I mentioned that one yet
 2   permeation, just migrating through under the
 3   pressure that's inside the tire.
 4              Sometimes cracked inner liner
 5   splices or open inner liner splices allow
 6   access beyond the inner liner into the body
 7   of the tire and up.  We talked about cuts and
 8   chunks and tears and so forth.
 9              So norm -- normal tire normal use,
10   that -- those are the ways I'm familiar with.
11         Q.   Moving to number 2, "Inadequate
12   bonding of the belt skims" and then you have
13   a variety of bullet points.  It talks about
14   "some trapped air impressions present on the
15   belt skim material."
16              Then, you go on to say:  "This
17   represents a manufacturing defect in the
18   subject tire."
19         A.   Right.
20         Q.   Are you saying this was a cause of
21   the failure?
22         A.   Yes.
23         Q.   In your report you don't say where
0102
 1   you observed trapped air impressions.
 2         A.   Yes, I did, in the notes.  That's
 3   why we clipped the photos because we were
 4   looking at areas where trapped air channels
 5   existed.
 6              It's on page 21.  275-300 degrees
 7   serial side, there's a trapped air channel on
 8   the #2 belt wedge.  At 310-330 center -- I'm
 9   sorry -- at 325-10 SS trapped air channel on
10   #2 belt wedge.
11              On page 22, 275-95 SS trapped air
12   channel on #3 belt.
13         Q.   None of those are where you say
14   the separation began, though; correct?
15         A.   Yeah.  As far as, once it became a
16   full separation, that was happening more to
17   the SOS side.
18              So these are defects that affect
19   the bond -- localized bonding in the rubber.
20   So it doesn't offer any resistance.  It come
21   across smoothly and images show how smooth
22   that rubber is but it's not in the area where
23   it had been polishing to the degree that we
0103
 1   are seeing belts sticking through the rubber,
 2   shiny belt cables.
 3         Q.   You're still saying this was a
 4   cause of the tire failure?
 5         A.   Yeah, for the reason I just said.
 6   It's localized air pockets in the tire.
 7              It's the oxygen degrading rubber
 8   around it and we certainly have the oxidative
 9   breakdown, that is from oxygen degradation of
10   the rubber and then localized weakness in the
11   tire due to that and consistent with Mr. Su's
12   testimony it can cause tread separation.
13         Q.   So you testified earlier that the
14   tread belt separation began in the 150-175
15   area of the -- of the serial side?
16         A.   Serial opposite side.
17         Q.   Serial opposite side.  Sorry.
18              You're saying trapped area impres-
19   sions elsewhere on the tire contributed to
20   the separate at the 150-175 area on the
21   serial opposite side?
22         A.   Yes, because the presence of the
23   oxidation that I see is obliterated in the
0104
 1   area where the belts are brushing.  I'm not
 2   assuming it was there but I'm seeing it else-
 3   where and showing that this is a condition
 4   that existed between these two bonded belts,
 5   working belts in the tire, belt 2 and belt 3.
 6              So this condition weakens when the
 7   tread separation commences.  These two areas
 8   don't bond.  They're smooth and the images
 9   depict that.
10              So that's -- that's not offering
11   any resistance to tread separation.  As well,
12   that air or moisture that was put into the
13   tire at the time that it was manufactured and
14   cured, that then can degrade around the belts
15   themselves and, while these trapped areas are
16   smooth within themselves, there's oxidation
17   around them.
18              I'm just saying the major crescent
19   shaped zone, the one that's ultimately the
20   culprit at the point of lift is a zone on the
21   opposite shoulder that's much larger and it
22   migrated across until it consumed the tire's
23   adhesion -- adhesion levels.
0105
 1         Q.   So you're just not answering the
 2   question so I'll keep asking it.
 3              Are you saying these observations
 4   elsewhere on the tire caused the separation
 5   at the 150-175 opposite serial side?
 6         A.   Contributed to cause it, yes.
 7         Q.   Okay.
 8         A.   I mean, I'm not -- I'm not writing
 9   this report to talk about things that are un-
10   related to a tread separation.
11              I know tire forensics, I know tire
12   design, I know tire failure, I know what the
13   likely causations are and when I see trapped
14   air impressions in rubber and liner imprints
15   in rubber and oxidation breakouts in the
16   belts, I'm -- if I hear hoof -- hoof prints,
17   I don't think zebras.  This is very familiar
18   to me after more than 35 years of being in
19   the industry and working for myself in this
20   capacity.
21         Q.   Are there any studies or papers
22   that say trapped air impressions in part of
23   the tire cause a tread belt separation in
0106
 1   another part of the tire?
 2         A.   Not without breaking protective
 3   orders in other matters.
 4              The industry doesn't tell on it-
 5   self.  So there's not much in the way of
 6   literature.
 7              You mentioned ITEC a moment ago
 8   and, one, the chances of ITEC peer reviewing
 9   a paper for me are remote.
10              I am the subject of ITEC meetings.
11   I have people who called me to say "Your name
12   was just brought up on the stage."  So, one,
13   that's a very biased industry-oriented help-
14   us-in-defense build a literature and peer-
15   review conference.
16              So that there's not literature, I
17   want the Court to understand in this case, as
18   a Court in Georgia mentioned in a Daubert re-
19   sponse to a Daubert challenge of me, obvious-
20   ly, there's no unbiased location for litera-
21   ture for both parties to come to.  It doesn't
22   exist in this tire litigation world.
23              So the fact that there's not an
0107
 1   article about trapped air pockets leading to
 2   tread separation still doesn't overarch the
 3   issue that Mr. Su testified that tapped air
 4   in tires can cause tread separation, which is
 5   consistent with my understanding and training
 6   in the industry.
 7         Q.   My question was:  Are there any
 8   published studies that support your claim
 9   that trapped air causes tread belt separa-
10   tions?  It's a yes or no question.
11         A.   I'm not seeing anything in my
12   reference list that is an article on trapped
13   air that specifies that comment.
14         Q.   Okay.  Just out of curiosity, your
15   reference here to Tire Defect Litigation, are
16   you references your own chapter when you make
17   that reference or are you referencing someone
18   else's chapter?
19         A.   That's the images and chapter that
20   I contributed to on trapped air.
21         Q.   So you're referencing yourself?
22         A.   Yes.
23         Q.   Okay.  Next, you talk about liner
0108
 1   pattern marks present on the belt skim mater-
 2   ial.
 3         A.   Yes.
 4         Q.   And the last sentence says:  "When
 5   they're" -- "when these are observed in the
 6   tire post cure it is strong physical observ-
 7   able evidence that a proper bond did not
 8   occur."
 9              Are you actually giving an opinion
10   that that occurred in this case and that it
11   was a cause of the separation?
12         A.   Are you asking am I giving the
13   opinion that the bond is weaker over an area
14   of liner pattern marks?
15         Q.   So the last sentence says:  "When
16   these are observed in the tire post cure, it
17   is strong physical observable evidence that a
18   proper bond did not occur."
19              Is it first your opinion that a
20   proper bond did not occur with this tire?
21         A.   Yes.
22         Q.   And are you saying that is a cause
23   of the separation that occurred in this case?
0109
 1         A.   Correct.  That's the header of
 2   number 2:  "Inadequate bonding of the belt
 3   skims as evidenced by trapped air and liner
 4   imprints."
 5         Q.   You're saying that this is one of
 6   the causes?
 7         A.   That's right.
 8         Q.   So you're saying the presence of
 9   liner pattern marks was observed at the point
10   of separation?
11         A.   Well, they don't get to be at --
12   observed at the point of separation because
13   of the polishing that's occurred between the
14   two surfaces.
15              As I explained to the jury earlier
16   this movement, the microcompressions, the
17   polishing that's occurring and brushing to
18   the point in some areas we didn't have any
19   rubber over the belt wires any longer but
20   surrounding that area are locations of liner
21   imprints just like with the trapped air.
22              Now, did they exist?  The jury
23   will have to decide if they think it existed
0110
 1   in the area of actual now affected polished
 2   oxidized rubber and exposed wire because I'm
 3   not going to say that it was there.
 4              I didn't see it and I also didn't
 5   see -- like I didn't see a repair patch.  I'm
 6   not going to say it's there when there's no
 7   evidence of it.
 8              And I think especially in federal
 9   court it -- it demands that kind of rigor but
10   I'm seeing it leading up to that area and the
11   surrounding areas of the two bonds between
12   belts 2 and 3 and I -- from my training, as
13   I said earlier, I was told and shown to strip
14   back looking for liner imprints.  If you find
15   them, the -- the material is too old; go tell
16   the factory, refresh components, quit using
17   this roll and that's very consistent with
18   what Mr. Su said.
19              I believe that the liner imprints
20   suggests improper bond and that the tire
21   never rubber-to-rubber chemically bonded as
22   it should have so it would have the strength
23   of the bond in that area that it -- that was
0111
 1   anticipated for it.
 2         Q.   You'd referenced earlier that
 3   inside your box is a sample of inner liner
 4   that was provided in this litigation.
 5              Have you compared that sample to
 6   your photographs of the tire?
 7         A.   I've looked at it and there are
 8   some similarity in it.
 9              I don't know if it was represented
10   as identical but there's some similarity in
11   the wave and the pitch of the spacing amongst
12   the threads in the weave.
13         Q.   So you have done measurements to
14   see if it's the same spacing and pitch?
15         A.   I haven't measured it.  I mean, I
16   think it can be done easiest under microscope
17   but I haven't done that yet.  If I'm asked to
18   do that for a trial exhibit, we can do that.
19         Q.   Next, your third thing you say is:
20   "The subject tire lacks nylon cap strips or
21   cap plies."
22              What percentage of truck tires
23   manufactured worldwide have nylon cap or
0112
 1   strip plies?
 2         A.   I don't know.  I haven't done a
 3   survey.
 4              I know that Goodyear produced a
 5   patent based on their own analysis utilizing
 6   it and it had significant contribution to the
 7   tires durabilities.
 8              I also understand that the Hankook
 9   tire from Korea, they use strips on occasion.
10   I haven't looked beyond that to see who else
11   might.
12              So I understand the testimony of
13   Mr. Su that cap plies aren't necessarily ever
14   used by Double Coin in their medium truck
15   tires but he did suggest and I believe that I
16   allow for -- I've offered this technology as
17   one but I allow for other countermeasures to
18   tread separation and he mentioned a zero de-
19   gree steel band at the belt edges.
20              Had that been used, I think it
21   likely would've had some contribution to the
22   tires durability but it wasn't used in this
23   instance on this particular product.
0113
 1         Q.   Didn't Mr. Su testified that a
 2   zero degree belt was only used on extremely
 3   large off road truck tires?
 4         A.   I believe he did.  I don't think
 5   that dissuades what the propensity and the
 6   efficacy of the material is.
 7              Whether you use it in aircraft
 8   tires or not wouldn't make any difference to
 9   whether it could be used.
10              I understand that's what he said
11   it was used on.  I understood what I read.
12   I'm just saying that, if that is something
13   already in the wheelhouse, already available,
14   it would help to go in zero degree and wrap
15   the belt in so that they don't separate from
16   each other and start that process of the
17   initial crack propagation.
18              However, absent that, certainly
19   nylon or Kevlar or any of those materials
20   could be used.
21         Q.   You worked for Goodyear Dunlop for
22   several years right, 17 or 18 years or what-
23   ever it was?
0114
 1         A.   I started with Dunlop but, after
 2   '99, it merged into a joint venture.
 3         Q.   Yeah, and you said they have a
 4   patent for this nylon cap or nylon --
 5         A.   Strips.
 6         Q.   -- strips or cap plies.
 7              Do they use it all of their truck
 8   tires?
 9         A.   I'm not aware.  I wasn't -- that
10   -- their product wasn't my area of respons-
11   ibility but they -- they only specifically
12   notate two or three lines of tires that they
13   actually used in -- as support to the patent
14   which came out in '95.
15         Q.   Were those passenger tire lines or
16   truck tire lines?
17         A.   No.  This is all medium truck.
18         Q.   Are they still using those lines,
19   still producing those lines?
20         A.   I don't know.  I haven't asked.
21         Q.   You were there for 10 years after
22   this patent was issued; right?
23         A.   (No response.)
0115
 1         Q.   Were you familiar with it being
 2   used during the time you were there?
 3         A.   No.  I wasn't with Goodyear until
 4   '99 but I was responsible for Dunlop brand
 5   and I wasn't aware.  In fact, I only in the
 6   last few years found a patent.
 7         Q.   How did the absence of the nylon
 8   cap or strip line cause a separation in this
 9   case?
10         A.   Well, it provides a safety compon-
11   ent which cinches down and you have to under-
12   stand the kind of nylon that's used for tire
13   performance and that nylon is treated, dipped
14   and treated in such a way that you can -- you
15   know, Michelin talks about it in their patent
16   others talk about it, that, once it's applied
17   into a rubberized sheet and wrapped into the
18   tire on top of the steel belts so -- I don't
19   know if you can see this in the video or not
20   but this light truck tire has got two steel
21   belts here and between those belts and the
22   tread lug you can add a layer or two layers,
23   whatever you wanted, of the nylon over the
0116
 1   belts and under heat, when you're operating
 2   the tire and it's got -- you know, you've
 3   started moving and you're now building some
 4   operating heat in the tire, it constricts and
 5   so -- and it actually relaxes when the tire
 6   cools down but it constricts and acts as a
 7   tourniquet.
 8              If you place it and concentrate
 9   it, especially for the belt edges and however
10   much of the belt edge you need to do, when
11   you -- when you apply it and you're operating
12   the tire and you've got centrifugal forces
13   acting and the tire is growing a bit in oper-
14   ation, it constricts the belts.
15              And so that's how it contributes
16   is it would be a safety component which can
17   reduce the growth of the belts and growth at
18   the belts becomes really significant when the
19   belts are separated from each other and now
20   you get egg shapedness or doming, those kinds
21   of results in the tire due to the underlying
22   separation.  It can retard that and that's
23   exactly what comes out of the patent.
0117
 1              Goodyear did the testing and they
 2   had a couple of tire lines that for -- they
 3   collected two data's -- two year's worth of
 4   data on and they had -- let me find the chart
 5   really quick.
 6              They were seeing two years before
 7   they added it in the 385 65R 22.5, same size
 8   as the subject tire.  In the GE-159 line and
 9   in the MT-2 line they had -- before they add-
10   ed it, they collected 1,198 tread separations
11   so they added it and collected data for two
12   years.
13              And, in the meantime, they almost
14   doubled their production numbers of those two
15   lines.  And so production numbers went from
16   139,000 to 267,000 and so they only had 411
17   tread seps versus -- so they reduced by 3 --
18   a factor of 3 the tread seps when they nearly
19   doubled their production numbers by using the
20   nylon cap strips on a 385 65R 22.5 tire.
21              So I think the efficacy of the
22   nylon, which is known in the industry anyway,
23   has been for years; but the efficacy of the
0118
 1   nylon in this application is spelled out in
 2   the actual patent.
 3         Q.   So are you -- is it your testimony
 4   that, if there'd been a nylon cap, this tire
 5   wouldn't have separated?
 6         A.   Not that day and I'm not here to
 7   tell you it would never have separated given
 8   the other defects in the tires but I believe
 9   the efficacy of the nylon would've been sign-
10   ificant to the tire's durability and I'm just
11   confident in that technology enough to say I
12   don't believe that day and who knows what
13   happens after that.
14         Q.   You've talked about a couple times
15   now that the tire will sort of -- not sort
16   of.  You said the tire will start to lose
17   shape.  You referred to egg shaped or, you
18   know, whatnot.
19              So wouldn't that -- you know, the
20   tire losing shape be evident to the driver of
21   the vehicle?
22         A.   Can be, cannot be.  I mean, I'm
23   not here to speak to driver kinematics and
0119
 1   what they are sensitive to as a driver.
 2              It could -- could be a vibration,
 3   might not be according to the suspension.  I
 4   wasn't there.  I don't know.  I -- I can't
 5   say.  I'm not speaking to --
 6         Q.   Have you done any studies or tests
 7   to see about the -- to see if as the tire is
 8   out of round, if it's noticeable to a driver
 9   or not?
10         A.   I have.  In the -- in the terms of
11   uniformity which is -- we used to study high-
12   way speeds putting passenger and light truck
13   tires on vehicles and running down a course,
14   looking for the drift, looking for any vib-
15   ration, analyzing that versus what the tire
16   measured as for uniformity; lateral force and
17   vertical force, balance, those kinds of basic
18   things and then learning how we could tighten
19   it up because one of our competitors -- we
20   felt Michelin had a better bead cable and it
21   produced a better uniformity for that tire.
22              That was a vibration issue and not
23   out of round in the way that I'm describing
0120
 1   it here.  Out of round in the way that comes
 2   back for claims after, you know, the latter
 3   part of a year of collection is usually not
 4   the "I don't like the sensitivity of the non-
 5   uniformity, I need a new balance weight on
 6   the wheel."  It's usually "I've got something
 7   underlying that is causing a concentrated am-
 8   ount of vibration and the tire can be chang-
 9   ing shape as a result of underlying separa-
10   tion."
11              The kind of vibration people that
12   aren't happy with in the initial drive is the
13   kind of thing they come right back with and
14   go "Switch that off, I'm driving, you know,
15   two" -- "two weeks in a row on that."
16              So we're talking about slightly
17   two different things with the same termino-
18   logy unfortunately in the industry.
19              Imbalance and out of round and
20   kinetics, those kinds of things that happen
21   as a result of how the tire was constructed
22   and how it drives new is different and not a
23   safety issue normally.
0121
 1              The safety issue is the tire is
 2   changing shape and many times in cases with
 3   medium truck tires the inspection doesn't
 4   pick it up but they stop at some point and
 5   there's a big dome in the tire egg shaped and
 6   this is because there's underlying components
 7   in there and their breaking their bonds with
 8   each other, usually the belts; and those are
 9   the things that can progress to demonstrate a
10   separation layer.
11         Q.   So, when I ask you to describe how
12   the premature oxidative degradation would
13   cause the tire to separate, you -- you walked
14   through the process and you got to the point
15   where -- and I wasn't clear on this.
16              Were you saying that, because of
17   the internal separation, it would actually
18   cause the tire to separate or is it from the
19   force of hitting the ground that would start
20   the separation?
21         A.   The former, not the latter.  I
22   don't the latter comment.
23         Q.   So you were talking about the
0122
 1   pressures on the tire with each revolution;
 2   right?  As the tire spins around, it comes
 3   into contact with the ground.  So all of that
 4   is pressure that was being put onto the tire;
 5   right?
 6         A.   (No response.)
 7         Q.   And so my question --
 8         A.   Let me -- just so I know that we
 9   are understanding each other better maybe, I
10   said, if I put an "X" on the tread piece --
11   but I'm holding just the 2-inch wide piece;
12   right?  And there's X's all the way around;
13   right?  Every place the tire is in contact
14   with the road is applying force down.
15         Q.   Correct.
16         A.   So it's always in stress at the
17   belt edges.  The a highest concentration is
18   at the belt edges always; but any particular
19   spot, if I put an "X" on the tire and rolled
20   it under the vehicle, as soon as it went into
21   contact with the road surface, there would be
22   a microcompression then and, as soon as that
23   flipped out of contact as it continue to roll
0123
 1   it would rebound.
 2              So we get these microcompression
 3   release, compression release; and they are
 4   contributing -- once oxidation makes it to
 5   the belt edge, they're contributing to the
 6   crack propagation.
 7              There -- that's the work -- to use
 8   physics terms, that's the work that's happen-
 9   ing that the compression cycles are chatter-
10   ing away this bond; and, if it's oxidizing
11   along the belt edge where it oxidizes more
12   readily than it does in the center of the
13   tread, there's no reason for it to oxidize
14   quickest in the center.  It's out on the cut
15   belt edge where it starts oxidizing first
16   where the load concentration is working that
17   area.
18              So it's not that it's hitting the
19   road that starts the belt separation per se.
20   It's that whole process of oxygen getting to
21   the belt edge, cracking that belt edge rubber
22   and then these microcompressions working that
23   weakness until it's a large weakness.
0124
 1              I don't know if that's answering
 2   you but I'm trying.
 3         Q.   So, somewhere along the way in the
 4   process as I'm trying to understand your de-
 5   scription of it, and we have the tread piece
 6   here; right?  A piece of -- a piece of that
 7   tread tears from the surface of the rest of
 8   the tire at some point; correct?
 9         A.   Well, when I say "tread," it's
10   also got belts under it.  It's -- it's separ-
11   ating between the belt and taking the tread
12   and belt with part of it and the rest remains
13   with the carcass on the rim.
14         Q.   And so the question I'm asking --
15   so you're saying that, you know -- you're
16   saying, because of the premature oxidative
17   degradation, your testimony is the 2 and 3
18   belts were separating?
19         A.   Yes.  Yes.
20         Q.   What would cause the 2 and 3 belt
21   -- so those belts obviously wrap around the
22   tire?
23         A.   Right.
0125
 1         Q.   I think there's even a little bit
 2   of overlap.  You know the splice is supposed
 3   to meet somewhere.
 4              So what caused the belt inside to
 5   break from -- you know, from the circle that
 6   it was otherwise because it's one -- obvious-
 7   ly it's one long piece of belt skim when it's
 8   put onto the -- into the tire; right?
 9         A.   So the weakest point in any of
10   the belts if I look at the x-ray is any space
11   between the wires.  They're all on diagonals
12   to each other and that's caused -- that's for
13   the purpose of panographing the tire; meaning
14   we put them on even opposite angles.
15              Let's say -- I'm guessing.  Let's
16   say 21 degrees -- and maybe I can look at the
17   spec and actually tell you what this one is.
18              Let's take 21 degrees in this di-
19   rection for first operating belt.  I'm just
20   talking about belt 2 and 3.  It's 21 degrees
21   in the opposite direction on the other belt,
22   belt 3, and that's done so that when the tire
23   cures in the mold it flattens the tread so
0126
 1   you can get 50,000, 60,000, 100,000 miles out
 2   of a tread.
 3              That's -- that's the purpose of
 4   that is equal opposite angles but the weakest
 5   point in the belt system other than if it's
 6   got a bad splice in it is between any cable.
 7              So, when it splits and you see the
 8   belt angles running like this, when it lifts,
 9   it lifts in the weakest spot and it rips be-
10   tween the belt cables and just comes up as
11   one piece or two pieces in this case.  Belt 3
12   and 4 come up in that way (demonstrating.)
13              This angle or this angle whichever
14   belt you're talking about, the belt lifts in
15   that weakest location and sometimes pulls
16   some other cables away in the pulling process
17   when it's lifting away (demonstrating.)
18              I don't know if that's answering
19   the question but you can see here's the first
20   belt and it's in this slow angle.  And "slow"
21   meaning larger than 21 degrees.
22              Here's the second belt right next
23   to it.  Here's the third -- the second belt,
0127
 1   first belt, second belt is out here, the wid-
 2   est belt and it goes back (demonstrating.)
 3              The third belt is this one and the
 4   fourth belt's in the same area but just nar-
 5   rower because it's there for the stone drill-
 6   ing and all that.
 7              In fact, when you retread it, you
 8   could actually peel that belt off.  It's only
 9   there for stone drilling.
10         Q.   Okay.
11         A.   This takes usually a day with my
12   clients at my office to do this whole "Help
13   me understand the oxidation process."  So we
14   are trying to accomplish it in a small period
15   of time.
16         Q.   I'm trying to get an answer from
17   you.
18         A.   Oh, I thought I was answering.
19         Q.   So my question is:  When the tread
20   belt separation occurs, at some point, you
21   know, the -- the belt skim is no longer one
22   piece, it -- a part of it breaks off; right?
23         A.   Yes.
0128
 1         Q.   What is the -- the -- what -- what
 2   is causing that break, that last step?  Is it
 3   -- I guess that's -- just what causes that
 4   break?
 5         A.   So, irrespective of the -- of the
 6   angle -- irrespective of the angle that I've
 7   just told you is in the belts -- and I showed
 8   you that the x-rays show that it's not zero
 9   degrees and straight across or whatever.
10              Assume that's a hoop of belt on a
11   building drum and then later in the finished
12   tire and we've got three more belts over it
13   and they're all spliced back so the beginning
14   -- as you said the beginning and the end sort
15   of lines up and becomes a splice that's the
16   spot.  It shouldn't overlap and shouldn't gap
17   it should be just butted right up.
18              When the next belt on top of this
19   one is working against this belt, if this is
20   belt 2 and belt 3 is on top and they're work-
21   ing against each other and they're starting
22   to polish and that polish is getting longer
23   around the tire and wider across the tire to
0129
 1   the point that all of the real adhesion in
 2   this whole system now is happening over in a
 3   small area on one side.
 4              Then, the -- the support for the
 5   whole system is that each belt is bonded to
 6   the one above it and ones below it all the
 7   way through and everything is else is all
 8   bonded above it and below it and there's no
 9   blue.
10              So you cured it at high temper-
11   atures.  You've cured it long enough that you
12   meant for it to get all the curing units into
13   the tire to make it turn, vulcanize, and be
14   something you can use in the industry, in the
15   market, and now top belt -- the belt above
16   this one if this is belt 2 is no longer fully
17   contacting and bonded to this so the weakness
18   causes belt 3 to peel off of belt 2.
19              And that weakness, that lack of
20   bond which is caused by the polishing going
21   on, the oxidation going on, the stresses of
22   loading and unloading that you see in those
23   polished surfaces is because they're not con-
0130
 1   nected anymore.
 2              So now belt 3, belt 4 on top of it
 3   which is just extra mass from the standpoint
 4   of this bonding and the tread thickness which
 5   is just extra mass from the standpoint of
 6   this bonding is slinging around and this belt
 7   can't maintain that force, it can't hold back
 8   against the centrifugal forces of mass in
 9   motion.
10              It's like taking a bucket of water
11   and spinning it on a rope.  The minute you
12   stop is the minute you're wet; right?
13              So this -- this is the function of
14   all the belts have to stay together or else
15   this thing spools out and that's what happen-
16   ed in the tread separation.  It spooled to
17   pieces.
18              That's the reason that it lifts
19   and unfolds itself basically as belt 3 is
20   peeling off and taking bits with it and other
21   section of belt because the bonding isn't the
22   same all through the tire.  After you've got
23   the weaknesses here and weaknesses there, the
0131
 1   bonding is at different levels within the
 2   tire.
 3              So we've got a piece of tread that
 4   has got belt 1, 2, 3, and 4 on it in certain
 5   areas and then only belt 2, 3, 4 in another
 6   area.  It's variable.
 7         Q.   So, going back then to my earlier
 8   question, you're not giving the opinion -- is
 9   it your opinion that a nylon ply on a 4-belt
10   tire would have prevented this separation?
11         A.   On that day.  I believe in the
12   technology enough to understand that it caus-
13   es restriction at the belt edges, which is a
14   precursor to a belt separation.
15              So, yes, on the day.  I can't say
16   it would've lasted forever.  I'm not offering
17   that testimony especially given other defects
18   I observed in the tire.
19         Q.   Are you ware of any four steel
20   belt truck tires that have nylon ply caps?
21         A.   I'm aware of some that have been.
22   Those that are in the patent.
23         Q.   Did those have four steel belts?
0132
 1         A.   Yes, at the 385 65 22.5.
 2         Q.   But not all 385 tires have steel
 3   belts, do they?
 4         A.   Name one that doesn't.  I don't
 5   know.  I mean, I can't think of one that
 6   doesn't.  I think that's the state of the art
 7   technology at this point.
 8         Q.   It is today.  I mean, this patent
 9   is from what, the '90s; right?
10         A.   And this tire is from the '80s.  I
11   mean, it had four belts in it.
12         Q.   And have you done any studies to
13   determine if this adding a nylon cap would've
14   lessened tread belt separations in any line
15   of tires?
16         A.   Yeah, I did that in the industry.
17   I mean, I had development in which I made
18   myself prove that I needed to put the extra
19   cost of the component of nylon in to -- your
20   question didn't say "medium trucks;" but, in
21   passenger light truck tires, I made myself
22   prove I needed to add the expense of nylon in
23   a tire that's still in the industry I believe
0133
 1   with the Toyota Tacoma.
 2         Q.   Passenger tires only have one or
 3   two steel belts; right?
 4         A.   Right.
 5         Q.   Are you aware of any truck tire
 6   studies where -- comparing performance with a
 7   nylon cap versus performance without a nylon
 8   cap?
 9         A.   I'm not aware of anything anyone's
10   published on it; and, again, I'd rely on the
11   study behind the patent.
12              It's not just patent material, it
13   is actually two year's worth of collecting on
14   each side of application of the nylon to the
15   same line.
16         Q.   On page 38, you try to talk about
17   eliminating other causes.
18              You state here that:  "It is not
19   generally accepted in the tire community that
20   impact damage can cause a tread separation."
21              What tire community -- who are you
22   referring to when you say "tire community"?
23         A.   Every major tire manufacturer.  I
0134
 1   ask or have my clients ask every manufacturer
 2   "Produce any impact testing you conduct that
 3   lets you know that this tire" -- "how this
 4   tire will perform toward tread separation."
 5   And without exception to date everyone has
 6   responded "We have nothing responsive to that
 7   request," which tells me that if you're going
 8   to suggest that an impact causes your tires
 9   to peel the treads and the belts off rather
10   than just burst like a normal impact would
11   do; one, you'd have the testing to support
12   it; two, you design around it based on the
13   testing; and I don't see that happening with
14   any manufacturer and I've testified to that
15   many times.
16              They -- they speak about a labor-
17   atory that does third-party testing for them
18   but it's not even a real world application.
19   It's a tire that Smithers at standard testing
20   labs.
21              They inflate a tire on a rim, they
22   overinflate it, they put a pendulum up with a
23   100-pound weight on the pendulum, they swing
0135
 1   a metal probe into the tire, and originally
 2   it broke through everything; tread, inner
 3   liner, all of it; and then they filed on the
 4   nozzle to the point that they could get it to
 5   break through the tread and just glance off
 6   the first -- the top belt and not fail the
 7   bottom belt.
 8              Well, that's pretty unique and
 9   it's always locked jig such that there's no
10   suspension support for the tire that normally
11   you would get in the -- in the real world.
12              I don't find that to be authora-
13   tative whatsoever but the main impetus to me
14   from a technical perspective is, if you would
15   testify to that impacts or allow people to
16   testify for you that impacts lead to tread
17   separations, you provide them testing and
18   there isn't any.
19              The industry won't respond there
20   is any and I can say from my experience while
21   I won't get into specifications of Goodyear,
22   Dunlop, or whatever, we didn't have tests for
23   that and I think that's very consistent.
0136
 1              So to me the industry is speaking
 2   in the absence of data that impacts don't
 3   cause tread separations in and of themselves.
 4         Q.   You're not aware of any industry
 5   publications that suggest that it can cause a
 6   separation?
 7         A.   Yeah, and it's all used in liti-
 8   gation but I'm not aware of any testing.  You
 9   can say anything you want but I'm not aware
10   of any testing on that point from the manu-
11   facturers who have all the wherewithal to do
12   it and none have.
13         Q.   Are you aware of any testing that
14   has been done to determine whether a liner
15   pattern mark is a defect?
16         A.   One, I don't think you have to
17   have testing to do it because Mr. Su agrees
18   that liner imprints are defects in tires, not
19   a wanted effect and they could cause tread
20   separations; but two, I'm aware of testing
21   that was done and at least testified about at
22   trial.
23              So I was there in the trial when
0137
 1   Mr. Southwell testified that, during an in-
 2   stance in which Bridgestone Australia had the
 3   tread separations in their medium truck tires
 4   they collected tires, they found they were
 5   leaving the material sitting on the floor too
 6   long, they weren't processing it, and they
 7   were getting liner imprints; and, when they
 8   peeled tires that had imprints versus didn't
 9   have imprints, they got a 70 percent drop in
10   adhesion force between the belts in those
11   tires.
12              I'm aware of his testimony at --
13   on it.  I haven't seen that testing because
14   it would be proprietary at this point but
15   that's all I'm aware of sitting here.
16              And, in conjunction to that, I was
17   trained to physically peel the tire apart
18   looking for those kinds of anomalies.
19              THE WITNESS:  Can we take another
20   5?
21              MR. BERGMAN:  Yeah, sure.

 2              VIDEOGRAPHER:  Back on the record
 3   at 12:38.
 4         Q.   You talk about here, you say that
 5   you tried to eliminate underinflation, over-
 6   inflation or overloading as a cause of the
 7   failure.  You say it played no role.
 8              Do you know how much weight was on
 9   the truck on the day of the accident?
10         A.   Again, I think it was carrying a
11   sand load.  We're talking about front tires
12   versus rear tires.  They're usually managing
13   the cab so it's not like they -- it has an
14   excruciating amount of force to the front
15   when you do that so I think that's manage-
16   able.
17         Q.   You go on to say:  "It played no
18   roll" and you say:  "Underinflation should be
19   a foreseeable event."
20              Isn't that why tires have guide-
21   lines for inflat to certain PSIs?
22         A.   Yeah, it is; but designers also
23   know that tires are not going to be operated
0139
 1   at optimal conditions at all times and most
 2   prudent manufacturers would say "We have a
 3   safety margin around some level of underin-
 4   flation for our tires or overinflation based
 5   on the components we've chosen."
 6         Q.   I'd asked you at the outset if
 7   you'd ever worked with Aub Ward before.
 8              How many times have you worked
 9   with the Kaster Lynch firm?
10         A.   Quite a few.  I go to trial with
11   them more than any other client I have.
12         Q.   Okay.  So how many times is that?
13         A.   I don't know.  I haven't counted.
14         Q.   Let me start a different way then.
15   How many current cases do you have with the
16   Kaster Lynch firm?
17         A.   I think of one I just testified
18   in.  I don't know how many I have on -- on my
19   files right now open.  I -- I don't look for
20   it for that.  I may have more than two or
21   three cases but I don't know what they are
22   sitting here.
23         Q.   How many -- how many cases do you
0140
 1   take a year?
 2         A.   It varies.  Actually, just this
 3   kind of work varies year to year so I -- I do
 4   what I can.
 5              I can't remember turning down one
 6   because of the amount of volume I was doing
 7   but -- and I think I've testified I've seen
 8   as many as 75 cases in a year and as few as
 9   30 or so.
10              So that's changed a little bit
11   since COVID but it's getting busier again.
12         Q.   30 to 70 would be a rough range?
13         A.   Most years.  There may have been
14   differences in some years but about that.
15         Q.   I'm sorry, how many cases do you
16   currently have with Kaster Lynch?
17         A.   I don't really know.  I can think
18   of one I juste testified in but there may be
19   others on the -- in the file that I haven't
20   touched in a while.
21              The hardest part is knowing when
22   things have settled and I didn't get informed
23   so sometimes I don't know if it's still ac-
0141
 1   tive or not until I sit down and ask.
 2         Q.   So, over the last five years, how
 3   many cases do you think you've done with the
 4   Kaster Lynch firm?
 5         A.   I don't keep a running tab so I
 6   can tell you what I think but I don't know
 7   how many that I could say that it is.
 8         Q.   How many do you think?
 9         A.   Maybe 30 or 40.
10         Q.   And, you know, looking at your
11   deposition and testimony history, it looks
12   like it goes back for about 20 years give or
13   take.
14         A.   Getting close.
15         Q.   Ever testify on behalf of -- of a
16   tire manufacturer?
17         A.   Oh, tire, no.
18         Q.   Have you ever given an opinion
19   that a tire was not defective?
20         A.   Yes.  I've testified about tires
21   that have failed in sidewall failure from
22   underinflated operation and I testified at
23   trial in one of those.
0142
 1              That's a different failure mode
 2   but I've testified to that, that it left the
 3   facility where it was mounted and it wasn't
 4   properly mounted, stuff like that.
 5         Q.   Was that just one time or more
 6   than one?
 7         A.   That's the one that was occurring
 8   to me as I was sitting here.
 9              I think I testified about a -- as
10   I was talking earlier about, if a tire is 20
11   years old and it looks like a 20-year-old
12   tire.
13              I had an instance like that where
14   the tire had been a spare in the back of a
15   Cadillac and it was taken to Bridgestone Tire
16   Center and they replaced three of the others
17   and left that one in place because the tread
18   looked good.  So it was 20-year-old tire that
19   failed on the way back from that facility or
20   something within the next 30 or 40 miles or
21   something to that.
22              When I looked at that tire, I did
23   not see any other manufacturing defects but
0143
 1   it was thoroughly oxidized through because it
 2   sat there in the -- in the vehicle inflated
 3   for all those years.
 4         Q.   Just more out of curiosity, do you
 5   not oppose Goodyear or Dunlop because of a
 6   conflict or because of choice?
 7         A.   I originally had a -- a severance
 8   agreement with them and so I didn't take any
 9   Goodyear Dunlop cases.
10              I don't know if that hasn't run
11   its course but I'm happy where I am.  I don't
12   need to invite any potential problems.
13         Q.   And the last part of your report
14   is reference materials.
15         A.   Yes.
16         Q.   Is this the -- the -- these are
17   the source of any external -- strike that.
18              These are the only external refer-
19   ences that you relied upon other than the
20   materials identified that you reviewed?
21         A.   No.  This is -- and this list of
22   materials is not specifically for this par-
23   ticular report.  This is a grouping of mater-
0144
 1   ials that I attach to multiple reports and
 2   then I referenced materials under those opin-
 3   ions that I offered in the Analysis section
 4   that may not be in that list.
 5         Q.   Okay.
 6         A.   And, in addition to that, I have a
 7   reference CD of basically my library.  So I
 8   -- I would reserve that I would use any of
 9   that at the time of trial.
10              To answer an earlier question, you
11   asked me when I wrote the report and I see
12   here that at least I had gone to trial in the
13   Crum case against Hankook in October 9th of
14   2024 when I attached my testimony list.  So
15   some place post that date I would say I -- I
16   submitted the report.
17         Q.   Well, I know that you submitted it
18   after that date.  Is that also when you wrote
19   it?  Different -- two different things.
20         A.   That's when it was finalized.  I
21   don't remember when I started it but that's
22   when it was finalized.
23         Q.   So, in your Analysis section, is
0145
 1   there a reason you did not include any speci-
 2   fic pictures with each of your analysis
 3   points?
 4         A.   I don't always do that.  Sometimes
 5   I do and sometimes I don't.  Mostly I don't.
 6              I've got the photos and they can
 7   be blown up bigger than what's in the picture
 8   -- I mean what -- what I could put in the
 9   report.
10              So I'm sure at time of trial there
11   will be those that are selected from my pho-
12   tos to demonstrate the individual issues we
13   are talking about.
14         Q.   That sort of answered my question
15   but didn't answer it.  Let me ask it in a
16   different way.
17              With your opinion number 1 about
18   oxidation, for example, why didn't you in-
19   clude specific pictures showing the oxidation
20   you claim exists?
21         A.   Because I knew that I was going to
22   print the pictures I'd taken of the oxidation
23   and collect them at the time of deposition to
0146
 1   make part of the file.
 2              I didn't -- it just bogs down to
 3   try to put a lot of pictures in a report and
 4   move it while you're copying your report so I
 5   keep everything oriented.
 6              I don't love doing it.  Sometimes
 7   I'll do it on certain occasions for certain
 8   issues but it's not my preferred method.
 9         Q.   Did you do any analysis of the
10   maintenance of the tire by Kent and Smith
11   Holdings?
12         A.   Not other that the visual tactile
13   inspection of the tire itself.
14         Q.   Did you do any -- you listed among
15   the materials all of the documents that Kent
16   and Smith Holdings produced.  Did you review
17   the maintenance records to determine how the
18   tire was maintained as part of preparing your
19   opinions?
20         A.   It was reviewed.  I don't remember
21   coming to any specific conclusion that stood
22   out from the documents but I did review it.
23         Q.   Okay.  Are you giving any opinion
0147
 1   regarding the maintenance practices of Kent
 2   and Smith Holdings?
 3         A.   I haven't been asked to do that.
 4   It's not part of my report.
 5         Q.   Have you done any analysis of the
 6   maintenance practices of Kent and Smith Hold-
 7   ings and how it could've contributed to the
 8   state of the tire at the time of the acci-
 9   dent?
10         A.   Just what in investigation of the
11   tire and examination of the tire presented
12   to me in my forensic analysis.
13         Q.   Okay.  So just like noting like
14   the -- the cuts or groove or chips or things
15   like that?
16         A.   That's right.
17         Q.   And you noted punctures in your
18   report.  Did you take into account those
19   puncture in performing your analysis?
20         A.   Yes.
21         Q.   In what way?
22         A.   In looking at the rest of the car-
23   cass, had those punctures actually resulted
0148
 1   in underinflated operation, there would tell-
 2   tale signs to the carcass; abrasions in the
 3   upper sidewall, extensive bead area damage;
 4   and I looked at that and was able to count it
 5   and threw it out based on the evidence it-
 6   self.
 7         Q.   Did you do any assessment or anal-
 8   ysis of the nature of the repairs made to
 9   those punctures and whether that contributed
10   to any condition on the tire?
11         A.   I didn't see any evidence of re-
12   pairs to any of the punctures.  So I'm not
13   confident that any of them went completely
14   through the tire, there's no evidence of that
15   and, had they gone through the tire and the
16   tire aired out as a result and then operated
17   in that condition, there would've been tell-
18   tale signs on the tire.
19         Q.   Okay.  Are you familiar with the
20   recommendations on how to properly repair a
21   puncture in a tire?
22         A.   I'm familiar with the recommenda-
23   tions.
0149
 1         Q.   Did you do any analysis to deter-
 2   mine whether any of the punctures were re-
 3   paired using those recommendations?
 4         A.   I didn't see evidence of any re-
 5   pair.  I also looked at your expert Grant's
 6   report and he doesn't define any repair in
 7   the tire.
 8              So I -- I think it feels like a
 9   red herring.  I don't think there's been any
10   repair to the tire.
11         Q.   Are you aware of any policies or
12   guidance or even guidelines about the use of
13   repaired tires as a steer tire?
14         A.   I think I noted that in one of the
15   reports, some comment about it being used in
16   another position besides steer but other than
17   that I wasn't aware of any specific guide-
18   lines on it.
19              I mean, certainly retreads can be
20   used.  So I'm not certain the implication of
21   using a repaired tire when a retread can be
22   used.
23         Q.   How much have you been paid for
0150
 1   your opinion to date Mr. Cottles?
 2         A.   Whatever the sum of the invoices
 3   is and whether there's another invoice for --
 4   I'll look again but whether there's another
 5   invoice for writing the report.  I don't see
 6   it listed here.
 7              I've invoiced at least with what I
 8   have in hand about $27,000 or $28,000.
 9         Q.   And is the amount of work you've
10   done many this case high, low, or typical of
11   the amount of work you do on a case?
12         A.   They're all different according to
13   how many testimonies I'm looking at, how many
14   tires I actually evaluate.  They -- they're
15   all different so I don't have a high, medium,
16   or low rank -- rank order.
17         Q.   Are you aware of any time that
18   your testimony has been excluded?
19         A.   It was limited on ability to test-
20   ify about oxidative -- the chemical nature of
21   oxidation ink Florida.
22              There was an instance in Texas in
23   a case called -- just a minute -- Lara.  I
0151
 1   called it -- the case as I knew it was Lara,
 2   L-a-r-a, versus Bridgestone.
 3              As I understand the situation, I
 4   offered late the opinion of the nylon cap ply
 5   separate from my initial report and defense
 6   counsel sought to have that opinion struck
 7   and, as I understand it, the Court ordered
 8   just to eliminate all my opinions; but it was
 9   a bench order, not a signed order.
10              So my -- so my client had already
11   settled at that point but they were present
12   to represent my interest in that and -- so it
13   never was a signed order as far as I know.
14              Another Texas case in which belt-
15   ing defect was excluded from -- or the Court
16   wouldn't allow me to talk about it because --
17   I didn't understand the ruling but because it
18   was not outside Michelin's own standards.
19              I don't understand that ruling be-
20   cause that doesn't have anything to do with
21   the forensics of it but that was what was
22   said.  I couldn't testify about the belting
23   defect and, because they didn't have a stand-
0152
 1   ard on liner pattern marks, that Court didn't
 2   allow me to testify about that but I was able
 3   to testify about oxidation, trapped air, and
 4   nylon cap plies.
 5              I don't think that I've ever been
 6   excluded on any matter in Louisiana, so we'll
 7   see what happens.
 8         Q.   What was the name of this latter
 9   Texas case you were talking about?
10         A.   Whit.
11         Q.   What was the Florida case name if
12   you recall?
13         A.   I don't recall it sitting here.
14         Q.   Subject to any questions that your
15   attorneys ask, I'm done right around my 1:00
16   o'clock target.
17         A.   Thank you.
18              MR. KONERU:  I don't have any
19   questions.
