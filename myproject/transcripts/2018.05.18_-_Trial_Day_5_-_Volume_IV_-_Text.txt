            3               THE COURT:  Dr. Jarvis, come on up.

            4               Good morning, everybody.  Please be seated.

            5     You're still under oath from yesterday.  You can go ahead

            6     and take the seat.

            7               And, Ms. Conlin, whenever you're ready.

            8               MS. CONLIN:  Yes, thank you, Your Honor.

            9                        DIRECT EXAMINATION

           10     BY MS. CONLIN:

           11     Q.  Good morning, Dr. Jarvis.

           12     A.  Good morning.

           13     Q.  I want to just finish up on a couple points that we

           14     we're dealing with yesterday.  I'd like to talk to you a

           15     little bit more about the studies that have been cited in

           16     this case.

           17               I'd like to add a column for orthopedic

           18     procedures, and so could I direct your attention to the Zinc

           19     article first.  Do you know how many of those were

           20     orthopedic procedures?

           21     A.  Zero.

           22     Q.  And how about in the Huang study?

           23     A.  Zero.

           24     Q.  How about Moretti?

           25     A.  20.




                                                                           657



            1     Q.  And how about Hall?

            2     A.  Zero.

            3     Q.  And in the interest of completeness, I'd like to add one

            4     other study, the Oguz study, if you could look in your book,

            5     sir, at Trial Exhibit 635.  And is this article entitled,

            6     "Airborne Bacterial Contamination during orthopedic surgery

            7     a randomized control trial?

            8     A.  Correct.

            9     Q.  What did they find in that trial with respect to whether

           10     there was an increase in bacteria at the surgical site when

           11     the Bair Hugger was used?

           12     A.  Well, they did agar plates around the operating room,

           13     and the one that was closest to the patient, wasn't really

           14     real close, but the closest is table or plate 4 in the study

           15     and that had an increase that almost reached statistical

           16     significance.

           17     Q.  And how many patients were in the Oguz study?

           18     A.  There were a total of 80 patients that were randomized

           19     to the forced air warming Bair Hugger versus an electric

           20     blanket, and then they were divided into laminar flow and

           21     non-laminar flow, but the bottom line is of these were all

           22     minor orthopedic procedures so not implant procedures and

           23     there was only one total knee.

           24     Q.  How many patients total?

           25     A.  In the forced air warming, 40.




                                                                           658



            1     Q.  And then what was the year of that?

            2     A.  2017.

            3     Q.  Okay.  Thank you, Doctor.  We talked a little bit

            4     yesterday about the Providence Hospital records that you

            5     reviewed and the depositions.  Did you see anything in the

            6     records that suggested that the Bair Huggers that were being

            7     used at Providence had been modified in any way?

            8     A.  No.

            9     Q.  Okay.  Finally, Doctor, I'd like to talk with and I'm

           10     going to give you a hypothetical.  We've heard a little bit

           11     about hematogenous spread or bacteremia, can you just

           12     explain to the jury briefly what that is?

           13     A.  Well, hematogenous spread is usually where you have an

           14     infection on another site so say a urinary tract infection,

           15     or abscess, skin abscess or pneumonia, and then you get a

           16     bacteremia secondary to that, and it can seed other sites.

           17     Q.  Now, I want to give you a hypothetical, Doctor.  I want

           18     you to assume that sometime after Mr. Gareis's surgery in

           19     November of 2010 that either during brushing his teeth or

           20     during a dental procedure, staphylococcus epidermidis got

           21     into his blood stream.  Are you with me so far?

           22     A.  Yes, ma'am.

           23     Q.  I want you to assume that that infection in his blood

           24     was asymptomatic, he wasn't having fevers or anything like

           25     that.  Are you with me, Doctor?




                                                                           659



            1     A.  Yes.

            2     Q.  And I want you to assume that that asymptomatic blood

            3     infection went down, skipped over his left implant that was

            4     implanted in 2009, and seeded in the implant that he got in

            5     his right hip in 2010.  Are you with me?

            6     A.  Yes, ma'am.

            7     Q.  Does that theory hold water?

            8     A.  Seems rather preposterous to me.

            9     Q.  Why?

           10     A.  Well, why would both implants not become infected?

           11     Q.  Did you see any evidence in the record that he had some

           12     sort of blood infection or a urinary tract infection or some

           13     other infection that could have seeded in the right hip

           14     only?

           15     A.  No.  And, furthermore, in terms of dental, brushing

           16     teeth or dental procedures, both the American Dental

           17     Association and the American Association of Orthopedic

           18     Surgeons had examined the data related to this and neither

           19     one of them recommend using prophylactic antibiotics for

           20     invasive dental procedures much less brushing your teeth.

           21     Q.  Okay.  Thank you.

           22               MS. CONLIN:  Your Honor, if we could just approach

           23     on a housekeeping matter, I'm ready to turn him over for

           24     cross-examination.

           25               THE COURT:  All right.




                                                                             660



            1               MS. CONLIN:  Thank you, Your Honor.

            2               (Sidebar discussion.)

            3               MS. CONLIN:  Your Honor, I want to make an offer

            4     of proof.  I want to be respectful of your rulings, but I

            5     would just like to go through the exhibits that I would have

            6     introduced with him.

            7               THE COURT:  Yeah, not now.

            8               MR. BLACKWELL:  I'm sorry, Your Honor, I didn't

            9     hear, but that's all right.

           10               MS. CONLIN:  When would you like me to do it, Your

           11     Honor?

           12               THE COURT:  Not now.

           13                           (IN OPEN COURT)

           14               THE COURT:  Mr. Gordon, is this you?

           15               MR. GORDON:  It is I, Your Honor, thank you.

           16               THE COURT:  Thank you, Ms. Conlin.

           17               MS. CONLIN:  Thank you.

           18               MR. GORDON:  May I approach with this?  Thank you,

           19     Your Honor.

           20                          CROSS EXAMINATION

           21     BY MR. COREY GORDON:

           22     Q.  Good morning, Dr. Jarvis.

           23     A.  Good morning.

           24     Q.  I'm Corey Gordon.  I'm one of the lawyers representing

           25     3M.  We met a couple of times before at your deposition,




                                                                             661



            1     haven't we?

            2     A.  Correct.

            3     Q.  Okay.  And I've given you a book of some of our exhibits

            4     we're going to talk about in due course.  But for the time

            5     being, keep the plaintiff's big notebook in front of you

            6     because I want to use that for a while.

            7               First of all, you're here today and yesterday to

            8     offer to the jury expert medical and scientific testimony,

            9     right?

           10     A.  Correct.

           11     Q.  And as a scientist, a medical scientist, you would agree

           12     with me that it's critically important that you remain

           13     objective in how you go about examining the scientific

           14     evidence presenting it, right?

           15     A.  Correct.

           16     Q.  And you've told me before that you coming to your

           17     opinions about the Bair Hugger have employed the CDC gold

           18     standard approach to how you go about doing the scientific

           19     research to come to conclusions, right?

           20     A.  Correct.

           21     Q.  And you'd agree with me that it's important for any

           22     scientist to keep an open mind whenever he or she is doing

           23     research, right?

           24     A.  Correct.

           25     Q.  A good scientist doesn't put on blinders and ignore




                                                                             662



            1     things that are contrary to whatever theory that he or she

            2     might be working on, right?

            3     A.  Usually not.

            4     Q.  Unfortunately, sometimes that does happen though, right?

            5     Scientists sometimes get kind of a tunnel vision and locked

            6     into their particular view of things and kind of screen out

            7     other facts?

            8     A.  Well, scientists are no different than other humans.

            9     Q.  Exactly.  For example, I'm assuming that as a

           10     pediatrician, as a pediatric infectious disease expert, you

           11     would probably agree that childhood vaccinations were

           12     perhaps the single the most or one of the top three medical

           13     interventions ever in terms of saving lives, right?

           14     A.  Very important, yes.

           15     Q.  And you know there's some medical scientists out there

           16     who have promoted the theory that some childhood vaccines

           17     cause various things, autism, what have you, if you're

           18     familiar with that, aren't you?

           19     A.  Certainly a minority, yes.

           20     Q.  Certainly a minority.  And, in fact, unfortunately that

           21     minority view, if you will, and the science that they've

           22     promulgated has actually cost a lot of lives, hasn't it?

           23     A.  I don't know that anybody has quantitated it.

           24     Q.  Well, would you agree that there are some people, some

           25     children who have died from diseases that they otherwise




                                                                             663



            1     would not have died from had they been vaccinated?

            2     A.  Sure.

            3     Q.  And my point simply is that there's a lot at stake when

            4     you're doing medical science, right?

            5     A.  There is.

            6     Q.  And when you were at the CDC, you oversaw and

            7     co-authored the CDC's 1999 surgical site infection

            8     guidelines, correct?

            9     A.  Correct.

           10     Q.  And the whole purpose of that was to educate the medical

           11     community on the best approaches to reducing surgical site

           12     infections, right?

           13     A.  Certainly at the time, yes.

           14     Q.  Okay.  And at the time using that CDC gold standard, you

           15     and your colleagues reviewed exhaustively all the literature

           16     that you could find, all the scientific studies, all the

           17     papers, everything you could find to try to come up with the

           18     best recommendations to the medical community and how to

           19     prevent surgical site infections, right?

           20     A.  I don't know that I'd say all, but we certainly tried to

           21     do an exhaustive examination.

           22     Q.  Forgive me for interrupting.  And sometimes you look at

           23     the medical literature, and it was kind of uniform and the

           24     answers were very clear, so you could give a clear

           25     conclusion and strong recommendation as to how the medical




                                                                             664



            1     community should proceed, right?

            2     A.  Correct.

            3     Q.  And sometimes the evidence wasn't all that clear, maybe

            4     you had a couple studies that seemed to point one direction

            5     and a couple of studies that seemed to point to another

            6     direction, right?

            7     A.  Occasionally.

            8     Q.  And we'll go over it in a little bit of detail, but just

            9     a general proposition, there were times in that document

           10     where you and your colleagues in informing the medical

           11     community about what the best approach to surgical site

           12     prevention would be you'd say unclear or no clear conclusion

           13     can be drawn.  And you didn't, and you specifically said

           14     we're not going to give you a recommendation on this

           15     specific thing.  Right?

           16     A.  Right, we call that unresolved issue.

           17     Q.  An unresolved issue.  Okay.  And there are lots of

           18     unresolved issues in science, right?

           19     A.  Correct.

           20     Q.  And the CDC gold standard approach that you employed in

           21     that 1999 document was aware there were unresolved issues,

           22     you made it clear that there were unresolved issues.  You

           23     didn't pick one side of the issue and just present that,

           24     right?

           25     A.  Correct.




                                                                             665



            1     Q.  And as a scientist and a physician, you'd agree with me,

            2     wouldn't you, that if you were making decisions and making

            3     recommendations to physicians based on evidence, it wouldn't

            4     be a good thing to just pick one or two studies that seemed

            5     to support a particular thing when you know there are other

            6     studies out there that actually make it unresolved, right?

            7     A.  Well, you have to obviously evaluate each of the studies

            8     and make a decision if you had one study that was very well

            9     designed and an excellent designed conducted study, and it

           10     showed a result in one direction and you had three lousy

           11     studies on the other side that showed a different direction,

           12     we probably would go with the former not the latter.

           13     Q.  Well, even in that case, sir, wouldn't you disclose in

           14     your the basis for your recommendations or the basis for

           15     your conclusions that you're concluding one particular way

           16     because there's a strong study, say a study that has a

           17     Class 1 evidence, and also cite the two or three or whatever

           18     studies that have much poorer evidence, so that that

           19     information is available to the scientific and medical

           20     community so it can be evaluated, right?

           21     A.  Might or might not.  Might just refer to the former.

           22     Depends on the case.

           23     Q.  Okay.  But it's a general proposition when there's an

           24     unresolved issue, the proper CDC gold standard and just a

           25     general approach to science is to disclose the whole truth,




                                                                             666



            1     if you will, both sides of the unresolved issue, right?

            2     A.  Well, I don't know that I word it as disclosing the

            3     whole truth.  Obviously, if you have a document that has had

            4     450,000 references in it nobody is going to read any of

            5     them.  If you have a document that has 50 references in

            6     them, they might read all of them so it depends on what your

            7     goal is.  We certainly did not -- I can certainly tell you

            8     from the 1999 CDC surgical site guideline, we did not

            9     reference every single paper we reviewed.

           10     Q.  Fair enough.  But you did reference some papers to

           11     illustrate unresolved issues that you pointed out in that

           12     document, right?

           13     A.  Well, more importantly, we tried to include references

           14     of those recommendations we were specifically making.

           15     Q.  And as a general proposition as a scientist, that's how

           16     you would expect other scientists to go about their business

           17     and how you go about their business.  In other words, you do

           18     your research, you do your review, and if there's an

           19     unresolved issue, you don't just pick a side and tell the

           20     world that's the resolved issue, the issue has been

           21     resolved, here's the answer?

           22     A.  Well, I guess I would word it differently.  It depends

           23     on what the publication is.  Is it a guideline publication?

           24     Is it a peer reviewed journal article publication?  The

           25     number of references you might have for the former would be




                                                                             667



            1     much larger then you would have for the latter, so it really

            2     depends on the type of publication you're developing.

            3     Q.  As a general proposition though, if there is an

            4     unresolved issue, you wouldn't want to mislead anybody by

            5     not pointing out the fact that it's unresolved, right?

            6     A.  Like I said, I don't understand what you're asking

            7     because obviously in the CDC guideline, it specifically says

            8     unresolved issue.  It doesn't usually then have 50

            9     references on both sides of that issue.

           10     Q.  Fair enough.  But it does -- if you could -- strike

           11     that.

           12               If an issue was unresolved, would you agree that

           13     it would be misleading to treat it as though it was

           14     resolved?

           15     A.  Well, if you're talking about in a guideline, like the

           16     CDC guideline, you have different categories of

           17     recommendation and then there's usually publications that

           18     are referenced that supposedly support that level of

           19     recommendation, so I'm not aware of the situation that

           20     you're describing.

           21     Q.  Well, let's put aside the guideline for a moment.  Just

           22     as a scientist and as a physician, when you're going about

           23     your objective analysis of the literature, the studies, the

           24     articles, if you -- if an issue is unresolved, wouldn't you

           25     agree that the proper approach as a scientist if you're




                                                                             668



            1     going to offer some opinions on it is to pick a side, if you

            2     will, but at least disclose it's unresolved, there are other

            3     views or contrary studies.  That's how a scientist works,

            4     right?

            5     A.  Well, I don't think I'd characterize it that way.  If

            6     you looked at the CDC guideline, whether you look at the

            7     2017 or the 1999 guideline, there are obviously

            8     recommendations at different levels.  And if we had a group

            9     of scientists in here discussing them, we probably would

           10     have a difference of opinion on the level of that

           11     recommendation here and there.

           12               The fact of the matter is most of the people on

           13     the HICPAC, the Health Care Infection Control Advisory

           14     Committee that advises on those guidelines don't read all

           15     those papers, so to say that every scientist reads every

           16     paper and puts everything down that they've looked at I

           17     think is misleading.

           18     Q.  I apologize if I'm confusing you with my questions.  I'm

           19     just basically trying to see if you agree that just as a

           20     general approach to science, if something is clear and

           21     resolved, you say that, but if there's genuine controversy

           22     or an unresolved issue, it would be misleading to ignore

           23     that which is unresolved, the other side, if you will?

           24     A.  I guess I'm still not understanding your question.

           25     Q.  Let me move on because you were right.  I shouldn't have




                                                                             669



            1     used the phrase "the whole truth" in talking about science,

            2     but you did take an oath here to tell the truth, right?

            3     A.  Absolutely.

            4     Q.  And part of telling the truth is telling the whole

            5     truth, not just a part of it, right?

            6     A.  Yeah, I would agree totally with that.

            7     Q.  And it -- you'd agree that you wouldn't want to do or

            8     say anything that misled the jury by being just partially

            9     complete, right?

           10     A.  I have not.

           11     Q.  Okay.  Let's start with something you said yesterday.

           12     You were asked by plaintiff's counsel how you came to be

           13     involved in this case, and you testified that you had been

           14     contacted by an epidemiologist from Washington, D.C., do you

           15     recall that testimony, sir?

           16     A.  Yes, sir.

           17     Q.  Now, based on what you just said, you certainly didn't

           18     want the jury to take away from that that you had been

           19     contacted by somebody connected with the government, the FDA

           20     or something like that, right?

           21     A.  I didn't say that, did I?

           22     Q.  No, you didn't, but you said it was an epidemiologist in

           23     Washington, D.C.?

           24     A.  That was a correct statement.

           25     Q.  Yes.  And that epidemiologist you don't even remember




                                                                             670



            1     her name, do you, sir?

            2     A.  I do not.

            3     Q.  And you didn't want the jury to think that the

            4     epidemiologist in Washington, D.C. whose name you don't

            5     remember was contacting you as part of an academic exercise

            6     or, you know, for a consultation on some emerging medical

            7     issue, did you?

            8     A.  I don't think I characterized it that way to the jury,

            9     no.

           10     Q.  You didn't characterize it at all, did you, other than

           11     that she was an epidemiologist from Washington, D.C., right?

           12     A.  I stated the fact, the truth just like you said.

           13     Q.  And you said she asked if you would be willing to review

           14     some materials about the Bair Hugger, right?

           15     A.  That's correct.

           16     Q.  Well, but you didn't tell the jury that she was actually

           17     an intermediary for one of the plaintiff's lawyers, right?

           18     A.  I don't recall characterizing it at all.  As I said, I

           19     said it was an epidemiologist in Washington, D.C.

           20     Q.  You didn't characterize it to the jury but you have

           21     characterized it in your deposition as that she was an

           22     intermediary, right?

           23     A.  I guess it depends on how you describe intermediary.

           24     She owns a company that does epidemiologic research, and she

           25     contacted me and asked me if I'd be willing to assess this




                                                                             671



            1     issue and talk to other people.

            2     Q.  Dr. Jarvis, do you remember having your deposition taken

            3     by me on July 25, 2017?

            4     A.  I believe so, yes.

            5     Q.  I believe you have it up there.

            6     A.  Okay.

            7     Q.  Oh, we have copies for you but I think you still have

            8     it?

            9     A.  Is it in here?

           10               THE COURT:  Easier to just bring another copy up

           11     if you have it.  This is it, right?

           12     BY MR. BEN GORDON:

           13     Q.  Dr. Jarvis, if I could direct your attention to page 10.

           14     A.  Okay.

           15     Q.  And if you look at lines 9 through 11, you'll see that I

           16     ask you so --

           17     A.  Let me ask you, is it page 10 at the bottom or page 10

           18     on each of the deposition pages?

           19     Q.  Very good question.  These are we call them minuscripts

           20     or condensed scripts, there are four transcript packages on

           21     one page, so I was referring to transcript page 10, in this

           22     reduced version, saving for the future at least it would be

           23     page 4 at the bottom, but the pages of the actual deposition

           24     transcript are in the little versions.  See that?

           25               So I'm looking at page 10, lines 9 through 11.  Do




                                                                             672



            1     you see that?

            2     A.  Yes, sir.

            3     Q.  Okay.  And so it was Mr. Ben Gordon who, and his law

            4     firm who initially hired you in this matter, right?

            5     A.  That's correct.

            6     Q.  Okay.  And now, if you jump over to page 11, lines --

            7     I'm sorry, the question starts on page 10 at the very

            8     bottom, line 24, I asked you, "Do you know how they found

            9     you or how they got to you?  They being Mr. Ben Gordon's law

           10     firm."  Do you see that?

           11     A.  Yes, sir.

           12     Q.  And could you read the answer that you gave on page 11,

           13     lines 5 through 9?

           14     A.  "I believe the contact was through another intermediary

           15     asking me if I would be interested in reviewing the material

           16     on the Bair Hugger."

           17     Q.  And you went on and said yes, and the next was a

           18     conversation with Mr. Ben Gordon?

           19     A.  Correct.

           20     Q.  So my question a few questions ago about this person in

           21     Washington, D.C., being an intermediary, doesn't really

           22     depend on what I mean.  I want it to mean what you meant it

           23     to mean when you said that under oath in July of 2017.

           24     A.  Correct, yes.  It's exactly it.  I got a call from an

           25     epidemiologist from Washington, D.C.  She asked me if I was




                                                                             673



            1     interested in reviewing materials related to the Bair

            2     Hugger.  I said yes.

            3     Q.  She asked you as an intermediary for plaintiff's lawyer

            4     Mr. Ben Gordon?

            5     A.  Subsequently, became known to me.  It was not known to

            6     me when I answered the call, and I said yes, I would.  She

            7     didn't say I'm working for someone else.  She said that in a

            8     subsequent conversation.

            9     Q.  Okay.  So when you told the jury yesterday that you

           10     first got involved in this case because of you were

           11     contacted by an epidemiologist from Washington, D.C., do you

           12     think that not telling them that she was actually acting as

           13     an intermediary for a plaintiff's lawyer was consistent with

           14     your obligation to tell them the whole truth?

           15     A.  No.

           16     Q.  Okay.

           17     A.  Seems to be fact to me.

           18     Q.  Okay.  And just for the record, Mr. Ben Gordon, is he

           19     here?  Way in the back.  Ah, and the only reason I'm doing

           20     that is because my last name is Gordon, and we're not

           21     related because he's much better looking.  I don't want the

           22     jury to be confused because I didn't hire you, right?

           23     A.  That's correct.

           24     Q.  Now yesterday you -- plaintiffs' counsel asked if you

           25     were paid for your work and you said that you were.  You




                                                                             674



            1     didn't say by whom at that point, right?

            2     A.  I wasn't asked.

            3     Q.  Yeah, okay.  Well, I'm asking who has been paying you?

            4     A.  Plaintiff's counsel.

            5     Q.  Okay.  And you were also asked if you knew how much

            6     you'd been paid, and you said you didn't know, right?

            7     A.  That's correct.

            8     Q.  Okay.  Now, in fairness, you probably haven't seen this

            9     because you're still on the witness stand and the lawyers

           10     couldn't have discussed anything subsequently with you last

           11     night, but we had asked the lawyers to provide us with your

           12     latest invoices, and although we still haven't gotten those,

           13     we did get yesterday a detailed printout of all the payments

           14     that had been made to you, at least by one of the

           15     plaintiff's law firms.  And if I could direct, I apologize,

           16     I started with Plaintiff's Exhibit book, but flip open to

           17     Defendant's Exhibit book, and if you could look at page or

           18     Exhibit D0958.

           19     A.  What was the number again?

           20     Q.  D0958.  Towards the back.  Okay.  And I think you're on

           21     the second page.  D0958-0002.  Do you have that in front of

           22     you?

           23     A.  Yes.

           24     Q.  Okay.  And this shows payments to you dating back to May

           25     of 2016 just about two years ago?




                                                                             675



            1     A.  Correct.

            2     Q.  And the total is $268,139.89?

            3     A.  Correct.

            4     Q.  Does that comport with your understanding of about how

            5     much you've been paid at least through last week?

            6     A.  As I said, I didn't remember so, but I'll take your word

            7     for it or their word for it.

            8     Q.  I'm just curious, if you've been paid over a quarter of

            9     a million dollars in the last few years, how would you not

           10     remember that?

           11     A.  Because it's been two years.  The payments come in

           12     periodically as work is done.  I don't keep a running total

           13     like this.

           14     Q.  Fair enough.  How much are you charging for your

           15     testimony here today?

           16     A.  $900 an hour.

           17     Q.  And since the opening of the trial, you've been sitting

           18     back in the benches there viewing most, if not all, of the

           19     trial proceedings, right?

           20     A.  Correct, since Monday.

           21     Q.  Are you billing for that?

           22     A.  Tuesday I guess.

           23     Q.  Are you billing for that?

           24     A.  Probably.

           25     Q.  Same rate 900 bucks an hour?




                                                                             676



            1     A.  No, a little bit less.

            2     Q.  What rate would you use for that?

            3     A.  Probably travel fee.

            4     Q.  What's your travel fee?

            5     A.  250 an hour.

            6     Q.  So tell me how that works, when you're like on a plane

            7     on behalf of a lawyer, you bill them $250 from the time

            8     you're in the air or the whole time you're away from your

            9     home?

           10     A.  From when I leave home until I get to where I'm going.

           11     Q.  So if you're gone for four days, let's say, you bill

           12     $250 per hour times 24 times four?

           13     A.  Well, no, that condition doesn't come out.  It's usually

           14     from getting from point A to point B because I usually can't

           15     be doing other work at that time and obviously when I get to

           16     the location, it depends on what's happening at the

           17     location.

           18     Q.  So you don't bill for sleeping in a hotel?

           19     A.  No.

           20     Q.  But when you get to the location, you might be doing

           21     actual work on the matter, right?

           22     A.  Correct.

           23     Q.  And you have a little bit of a lower billing rate for

           24     when you do review and research, right?

           25     A.  It depends on what I'm doing.




                                                                             677



            1     Q.  Well, let's talk about just specifically this case, what

            2     have you been billing plaintiff's lawyers for your research

            3     and review time?

            4     A.  It's on my fee schedule, 700 an hour for review.

            5     Q.  And was there a different fee for the time you were in

            6     the deposition?

            7     A.  Yes.

            8     Q.  What was that?

            9     A.  800 an hour.

           10     Q.  So just for trial you charge 900 an hour?

           11     A.  An hour, yes.

           12     Q.  And just for depositions you charge 800 an hour?

           13     A.  Correct.

           14     Q.  But everything else, all the work -- all the other work

           15     you do, all that exhaustive review stuff you charge $700 an

           16     hour, right?

           17     A.  Well, I didn't hear you made some "all the work you do,"

           18     and then you said something, and I didn't really hear what

           19     that was.

           20     Q.  And I apologize, I'm doing my best with my voice.

           21               All the work all the other work you do, the review

           22     of medical records, the review of literature, the drafting

           23     reports, those sorts of things, you charge 700, in this case

           24     you were charging $700 an hour, right?

           25     A.  For legal work, yes.




                                                                             678



            1     Q.  Is there some other kind of work that you've on this

            2     case other than --

            3     A.  I spend relatively small amount of my time doing legal

            4     work, so that's why I was worried when you were saying

            5     something I couldn't hear that you were talking about all my

            6     work because other work gets charged at different rates.

            7     Q.  Fair enough.  I wasn't clear.  For this case, other than

            8     your trial time, and other than your deposition time, you've

            9     been charging $700 an hour for the work you've done on this

           10     case?

           11     A.  Correct.

           12     Q.  So we take that together, well, at least through last

           13     week before you came here for the trial, that was over a

           14     quarter of a million dollars in two years?

           15     A.  So almost about the same as Dr. Wenzel got for his

           16     report for you.

           17     Q.  Okay.  And what -- you said that doing legal work is a

           18     small percentage of what you do?

           19     A.  Correct.

           20     Q.  Okay.  Over the last two years, what percentage of your

           21     work activities has been devoted to this case?

           22     A.  Boy, I've never done that calculation, but I would guess

           23     probably this case, 10 to 20 percent maybe.

           24     Q.  I'm sorry.  120 percent did you say?

           25     A.  Ten to 20 percent.




                                                                             679



            1     Q.  Ten to 20 percent, and will the other 80 to 90 percent

            2     have been other kinds of nonlegal consulting?

            3     A.  Some of it would have been legal, some of it nonlegal.

            4     Q.  So what percentage of your work activities in the last

            5     two years has been legal consulting?

            6     A.  I've never calculated it, but my guess would be probably

            7     in the 20, 25, maybe at most 30 percent range.

            8     Q.  So in the last couple of years, this has been kind of

            9     the main legal work you've been doing?

           10     A.  Correct.

           11     Q.  Okay.  Now, one of the things you billed for, you billed

           12     a little over $9,000 was to develop a study protocol, right?

           13     A.  Correct.

           14     Q.  You testified yesterday that one of your areas of

           15     expertise is the design of studies, right?

           16     A.  Could you repeat that?  I'm having a little difficulty

           17     hearing you.

           18     Q.  Again, I apologize.  One of the things you told the jury

           19     yesterday is that you're an expert in the design of studies,

           20     right?

           21     A.  That's one of the things I do, yes.

           22     Q.  And you also said you're an expert, by the way, in

           23     reading and interpreting scientific journals and articles,

           24     right?

           25     A.  Read a lot of them.




                                                                             680



            1     Q.  Okay, but in terms of study design, you would agree with

            2     me that before you do a study, it's important to have a

            3     protocol, right?

            4     A.  Well, I don't know it's a general statement.  I usually

            5     have a protocol for a study that I do, yes.

            6     Q.  Just in terms of we'll say the CDC gold standard, it's

            7     not a good idea to do something and collect the data and see

            8     how the data spread out and then decide how you're going to

            9     analyze it.

           10     A.  Well, I would say protocol covers more than just the

           11     analysis part.

           12     Q.  Absolutely.  You want the protocol involved would set

           13     out how you're going to collect data, what your end points

           14     are, what factors you're going to consider, and how you're

           15     going to analyze the data after you've gathered it, right?

           16     A.  Among other things, yes.

           17     Q.  Okay.  And just as a scientist and a physician, would

           18     you agree that it's not a good approach to medical science

           19     to collect data first and then analyze it?

           20     A.  Well, you always collect the data first and then analyze

           21     it.  How can you analyze it if you haven't collected it?

           22     Q.  Fair enough.  Without a protocol?

           23     A.  Well, I know you want to focus on the protocol, but I

           24     can tell you for CDC outbreak investigations, there is not a

           25     protocol for any of them.  So it depends on what you're




                                                                             681



            1     doing.  If you're doing a study that obviously involves

            2     human beings or animals, either one, you would by definition

            3     need to have a protocol or go through institutional review

            4     board approval.  But if you're doing an infection control

            5     assessment at a hospital, you wouldn't necessarily have a

            6     protocol.  If you're doing an outbreak investigation like

            7     CDC does, they don't have a protocol.  It's almost every

            8     case is individualized.  So it depends on the situation.

            9     Q.  Institutional review board, that's also referred to by

           10     shorthand as an IRB, right?

           11     A.  Correct.

           12     Q.  I think the jury heard yesterday on the video of

           13     Dr. Kurz that she said that a study that she did in 1996

           14     wouldn't today be authorized, couldn't get IRB approval,

           15     were you here?  You were here for her testimony, right?

           16     A.  Most of it, yes.

           17     Q.  Could you explain to the jury what IRB approval is?

           18     A.  Well, IRB approval is basically a committee that's at

           19     academic centers or hospitals.  Places where you would do

           20     some kind of study, and it involved let's limit to humans.

           21     If you do a study that involves humans, the IRB wants to

           22     review the study protocol to see what are you going to do?

           23     And does it have the potential to cause harm to the

           24     individuals involved?  And what kind of informed consent is

           25     included?




                                                                             682



            1     Q.  And would you agree that there have been scientific

            2     experiments done in the past that would today be considered

            3     unethical because what they learned from the experiments in

            4     the past was such a clear result that trying to do the same

            5     type of study and denying a control group be proven

            6     intervention would be unethical?

            7     A.  That was a long one.

            8     Q.  You're right.  I'll break it down.  And just I'll try

            9     not to use jargon too.  It's not really fair.

           10               When you're doing a study on medical treatments,

           11     medicines, devices, equipment, whatever you're trying to

           12     treat a disease or something like that, when do you a study,

           13     and your focused on something of interest a new medication,

           14     a new surgical technique, something like that, that's called

           15     in study language that's called the intervention, right?

           16     A.  Can be.

           17     Q.  And, well, a control group in simple terms would be a

           18     group that doesn't have the intervention you're interested

           19     in, right?

           20     A.  In some studies, yes.

           21     Q.  Then, well, I think you said yesterday and I apologize

           22     my memory is incorrect, but sort of the top level of

           23     research the gold standard is a randomized controlled trial,

           24     right?

           25     A.  Correct, that's what many believe, yes.




                                                                             683



            1     Q.  Do you believe that?

            2     A.  I guess I believe that you should look at all studies

            3     and that all epidemiologic studies have value and that

            4     randomize controlled trials, although, they theoretically

            5     are the best type of study because they control for the

            6     confounding variables that we talked about can be poorly

            7     designed.  And if you have an under-powered randomized

            8     control trial, by definition if it's under-powered, then it

            9     can't detect the difference.  So if you publish it and it

           10     looks, you know, somebody that says, well, every randomized

           11     control trial is wonderful, I wouldn't agree with that.

           12     Q.  Again, just so everybody is on the same page, what is a

           13     randomized control trial or oftentimes called an RCT, right?

           14     A.  Correct.

           15     Q.  Tell the jury what that is.

           16     A.  Well, in broad strokes, it is if we were to do a study

           17     with all of us here in the courtroom, and we're going to

           18     give a pink liquid to one group and not give it to another.

           19     So we randomize.  I would put everybody's name in a bowl,

           20     and I would pick the names out and put one for the pink, one

           21     for the not pink.  One for the pink, one for the not pink,

           22     until all of us were divided into the two groups and that

           23     theoretically by doing it that way rather than saying, well,

           24     I'm going to cut the room in half and this half goes to the

           25     pink and that one goes to the non-pink, theoretically,




                                                                             684



            1     gender is male and female is equal, underlying diseases are

            2     equal, and the only thing that's going to be different is

            3     one group is going to be exposed to the pink liquid and the

            4     other one is not.

            5     Q.  And if this were a medical study, would you refer to the

            6     pink liquid as the intervention?

            7     A.  If we're going to talk about doing a prospective study

            8     versus retrospective study that could well be the case.

            9     Q.  Fair enough.  Let's just talk about a prospective study.

           10     You can do a retrospective randomized control trial, right?

           11     A.  You actually could if people were randomized for some

           12     other reason, and the people have done secondary analyses of

           13     such studies, so yes, you could.

           14     Q.  But absent some prior randomization, you, looking back

           15     at something that doesn't lend itself to that study design

           16     of randomization and control, right?

           17     A.  Correct.

           18     Q.  And the looking back studies are almost always what are

           19     called observational studies, right?

           20     A.  Can be.

           21     Q.  There are different kinds, right?  There is nested case

           22     control and cohort studies, right?

           23     A.  Correct.

           24     Q.  And another one called an interrupted time series,

           25     right?




                                                                             685



            1     A.  Correct.

            2     Q.  Interrupted time series is really considered a pretty

            3     close to the bottom rung of observational studies, right?

            4     A.  I didn't hear you on that.

            5     Q.  Would you agree that in general if you were to do a

            6     hierarchy of epidemiological studies that an interrupted

            7     time series is considered pretty close to the bottom?

            8     A.  No, I don't think I would agree with that.  Some would

            9     say it's almost at the randomized control trial.

           10     Q.  Okay.  You also said something yesterday, you said that

           11     most findings in observational studies are confirmed by huge

           12     randomized control trials, right?

           13     A.  Generally, that has been the case both for infectious

           14     disease and cancer and other types of studies.

           15     Q.  But not always, right?

           16     A.  I'd have to look to find -- what I'm talking about is

           17     having a large body of observational studies, not one, not

           18     two, but a larger body showing an effect in one direction

           19     and then you would do a randomized control trial and it goes

           20     the opposite way.  It rarely can happen but most of the time

           21     it does show the same thing.

           22     Q.  Come back a second, what do you mean by "a large body?

           23     A.  Well, as I say, not one or two or maybe three or five.

           24     Q.  Okay.  And I know this is outside of your area, but are

           25     you familiar with the research that went into the decision,




                                                                             686



            1     the standard of care with respect to hormone replacement

            2     therapy for postmenopausal women?

            3     A.  I would say that's outside my area of expertise.

            4     Q.  So you have never heard that there was a huge

            5     observational study, the nurses study, that concluded that

            6     hormone replacement therapy was very beneficial and based on

            7     that, that became a standard approach to treatment, but then

            8     when robust randomized control trials were done, not only

            9     did that prove to be a beneficial thing but it proved to

           10     have very serious side effects.

           11     A.  Well, I've not reviewed all those studies, so I don't

           12     know how many were on that positive side before the

           13     randomized control trial on the negative side.  I don't know

           14     if it continues to be a controversy, and you have two

           15     randomized control trials that have shown different things.

           16     Like I say, it's not an area that I've done research in.

           17     Q.  Well, at the risk of putting everybody to sleep, we'll

           18     come back to the epidemiological stuff later.

           19               Now, yesterday you said that you were the chair of

           20     the FDA, was it the general hospital and personal devices

           21     panel?

           22     A.  Personal uses.

           23     Q.  Personal uses, I'm sorry.

           24     A.  Correct.

           25     Q.  And you didn't want the jury to take away from that that




                                                                             687



            1     you have some official employment relationship with the FDA,

            2     right?

            3     A.  I didn't say that, did I?

            4     Q.  No.  And you wouldn't want the jury to think that your

            5     opinions reflect the opinions of the FDA in this matter,

            6     right?

            7     A.  I didn't say that either, did I?

            8     Q.  I just want to make clear that when the mere fact that

            9     you are a chair of this, what did you call it an advisory

           10     panel?

           11     A.  Correct.

           12     Q.  That that doesn't mean that whatever your opinions are

           13     consistent with whatever the FDA's opinions are?

           14     A.  It does not.

           15     Q.  In fact, in this case you know that they're not, right?

           16               MS. CONLIN:  I object, Your Honor, and subject to

           17     the motion in limine ruling.  Or Court Docket 206.

           18               THE COURT:  The objection is overruled.

           19     BY MR. COREY GORDON:

           20     Q.  You know, sir, that the FDA examined the issue of

           21     whether forced air warming increases the risk of surgical

           22     site infection concluded last year --

           23               MS. CONLIN:  Objection, Your Honor, same

           24     objection.

           25               THE COURT:  Why don't you approach the bench.




                                                                             688



            1                       (Sidebar discussion.)

            2               THE COURT:  I overruled the first objection

            3     because I wasn't sure the FDA is just like a glancing part

            4     of that question, but then the second one makes it clear

            5     you're asking about it.  How is that not going to follow

            6     the -- we're not going to get into that or did you want to?

            7               MR. COREY GORDON:  I think our concern was that

            8     his discussion of his chairmanship of this FDA panel and

            9     perhaps we've closed the door on that.

           10               THE COURT:  I think you covered that.

           11               MS. CONLIN:  He didn't go into it.  He just listed

           12     everything the CDC has done.  I would like it stricken from

           13     the record.

           14               THE COURT:  No.

           15                           (IN OPEN COURT)

           16               THE COURT:  And next question.

           17     BY MR. COREY GORDON:

           18     Q.  When was the last time that committee met?

           19     A.  Excuse me?

           20     Q.  That FDA general hospital and personal uses panel, when

           21     was the last time it met?

           22     A.  I couldn't tell you.  It was over a year ago.

           23     Q.  And maybe even more than two years ago?

           24     A.  As I say, it's over a year.  I don't remember.  It's

           25     infrequent.  It's when the FDA decides they have an issue




                                                                             689



            1     they want to discuss.

            2     Q.  It's not a regularly scheduled meeting quarterly or

            3     whatever, just whenever?

            4     A.  Correct.

            5     Q.  And over the period of time that you've been chairman of

            6     that advisory panel, how many times has it been convened?

            7     A.  I'm guessing I'd say probably four or five times.

            8     Q.  Okay.  You've been chair since when?

            9     A.  I'd have to look at my CV.  It's been a number of years.

           10     Q.  So it's not a very frequent activity, is that fair?

           11     A.  Correct.

           12     Q.  Okay.  I want to go back now, to the gold standard

           13     approach you've taken to arrive at your opinions here.  And

           14     I just want to review, you said the first thing you did was

           15     you reviewed Mr. Gareis's medical records, right?

           16     A.  Correct.

           17     Q.  You reviewed them all, right?

           18     A.  All that I received, yes.

           19     Q.  Okay.  Did there appear to be anything missing from what

           20     you received that you had to ask for?

           21     A.  Well, I didn't ask for anything specifically, so I don't

           22     know how I would know if something was missing.

           23     Q.  Okay.  Well, part of your opinion is based on your

           24     conclusion that there's nothing in the record that points to

           25     some alternative cause, right?




                                                                             690



            1     A.  Correct.

            2     Q.  Okay.  In order to know that, you have to look at all

            3     the records, right?

            4     A.  And I believe I did.

            5     Q.  Okay.  And the second part of your gold standard

            6     approach was to do a comprehensive search for literature and

            7     a review of all the studies that would impact on this,

            8     right?

            9     A.  I've tried, yes.

           10     Q.  And when you're doing that research, you looked for

           11     studies that pointed to the Bair Hugger and your view and

           12     you look for studies that might have said, well, no, maybe

           13     not, right?

           14     A.  Correct.

           15     Q.  You tried to gather it all and weigh it and consider it

           16     and then render your opinion, right?

           17     A.  Exactly.

           18     Q.  Okay.  And if an issue was unresolved, how did you

           19     handle it?

           20     A.  Well, I guess I would say that I looked at the data,

           21     assess the data, and I looked at the design of the study and

           22     I reached my conclusion based upon those data.

           23     Q.  Okay.  Now, you came to your opinion before you had any

           24     testimony of the treating physicians or the treating

           25     personnel to review, right?




                                                                             691



            1     A.  You mean the deposition?

            2     Q.  Right.

            3     A.  I had their medical records, but I didn't have their

            4     deposition, yes.

            5     Q.  Okay.  The other thing you mentioned was that you read

            6     other expert reports in this case; is that right?

            7     A.  I did review other expert reports, yes.

            8     Q.  Okay.  Was there anything that I've left out in what you

            9     did to come to your opinions?

           10     A.  No, I think medical records, expert reports, deposition,

           11     large volume of literature.

           12     Q.  Okay.

           13     A.  Guideline recommendations I guess would be a part of

           14     that, too.

           15     Q.  Just to be clear though, you rendered your opinion

           16     before the depositions of the treaters had been taken,

           17     right?

           18     A.  I'd have to look at the dates, but I certainly looked at

           19     the medical records where they have documented what they

           20     believe was going on.

           21     Q.  Okay.  I assume you met Mr. Gareis by now, right?

           22     A.  Yes.

           23     Q.  When did you meet him?

           24     A.  Tuesday.

           25     Q.  Prior to Tuesday, you had never met him, is that right?




                                                                             692



            1     A.  That's correct.

            2     Q.  Prior to Tuesday, had you ever spoken with him?

            3     A.  No.

            4     Q.  Okay.  Now, you live in Hilton Head, South Carolina, is

            5     that right?

            6     A.  Correct.

            7     Q.  I'm a little confused because I thought you lived

            8     somewhere else.  Do you have two places?

            9     A.  We spend part of our time on one coast and part on the

           10     other.

           11     Q.  Okay, so that's why I had to come to San Francisco for

           12     your deposition, is that the other place you live?

           13     A.  Well, it's in Oregon.

           14     Q.  Okay.  Minnesota we have a lot of snowbirds, like

           15     Oregon, Hilton Head, is it like summer in Oregon, and winter

           16     in Hilton Head, is that how it works?

           17     A.  That's about right.

           18     Q.  Okay.  So when you were doing your research and review

           19     and the work you did to come to your conclusions, basically,

           20     you're doing that in Hilton Head or your west coast home?

           21     A.  Or wherever I happen to be.  As long as I have a

           22     connection to the Internet, I'm good.

           23     Q.  It's the 21st century, isn't it?  Okay.  And when you're

           24     in Hilton Head, you're only about one hundred miles from

           25     Columbia, South Carolina, right?




                                                                             693



            1     A.  Probably true.  I don't know the exact mileage, but it's

            2     not that far.

            3     Q.  Did you ever suggest driving over to Columbia to meet

            4     Mr. Gareis before you drew any conclusions?

            5     A.  No, I was reading the medical record.  I thought that

            6     was more important.

            7     Q.  Did you ever think about driving over to Columbia to

            8     talk to his treating doctor, Dr. Presnal?

            9     A.  No.

           10     Q.  Did you ever think about going over, hopping on the

           11     highway and going over to the hospital to interview the

           12     nurses who are involved in his care?

           13     A.  If they're still there since it was seven years later.

           14     Q.  So you're saying you did do it or you didn't?  I mean

           15     you didn't do that, did you?

           16     A.  No.

           17     Q.  Did you think that that would have been a useful thing

           18     to do?

           19     A.  No.

           20     Q.  Okay.  And you didn't interview any other medical

           21     personnel, other surgeons, you didn't interview his physical

           22     therapy people, right?

           23     A.  That's correct.

           24     Q.  Have you ever been to Columbia?

           25     A.  Yes, I have.




                                                                             694



            1     Q.  Have you ever been to Providence Hospital?

            2     A.  No, I have not.

            3     Q.  So you've never seen OR number 4 in the Providence

            4     Hospital where Mr. Gareis's surgery took place, have you?

            5     A.  I've seen pictures but not been there.

            6     Q.  You didn't see those pictures until well after you

            7     rendered your opinion though, right?

            8     A.  Correct.

            9     Q.  And before you rendered your opinion, you didn't ask to

           10     go see the OR, did you?

           11     A.  No, I did not.

           12     Q.  Again, I'm going to go to our exhibits here.  If you

           13     would turn to D0089.  And what were the years you were with

           14     the CDC again?

           15     A.  1980 to 2003.

           16     Q.  Okay.  So as part of your job at the CDC, you and your

           17     group were called in to hospitals and health care

           18     institutions to conduct investigations into causes of

           19     different infectious problems, right?

           20     A.  Or other adverse events of health care, yes.

           21     Q.  Among other things, but one of them included infections,

           22     right?  One of the things that you would be called in to

           23     investigate would be infections?

           24     A.  That was one, yes.

           25     Q.  And what I'm showing you Exhibit D0089 is a paper that




                                                                             695



            1     you and your colleagues published about one of those

            2     investigations that you did when you were part of the CDC,

            3     right?

            4     A.  That's correct.

            5     Q.  Okay.  And you use the CDC gold standard approach

            6     obviously to do this, right?

            7     A.  Yes.

            8     Q.  Okay.  In this particular case you were looking at the

            9     risk factors for wound infections after total knee

           10     arthroplasty, right?

           11     A.  Correct.

           12     Q.  And just to be clear, you weren't just looking at

           13     superficial infections, you were looking at the deep

           14     periprosthetic joint infections we've been talking about,

           15     right?

           16     A.  I believe most of them were, yes.

           17     Q.  And the reason you were called in to -- strike that.

           18               This was a couple of hospitals in Tennessee, as I

           19     recall; is that right?

           20     A.  Correct.

           21     Q.  And you've been called in because there appeared to be

           22     an usually high rate of infections associated with one

           23     particular surgeon, right?

           24     A.  Correct.

           25     Q.  And you referred to that surgeon in your paper as




                                                                             696



            1     surgeon X, right?

            2     A.  Correct.

            3     Q.  And in fact, you say that, you know, on an initial

            4     analysis that surgeon X was associated with 18 of the

            5     procedures that had a subsequent infection and had a risk

            6     ratio relative risk of 9.4, right?

            7     A.  Correct.

            8     Q.  And based on what you said yesterday about what that

            9     means that that means that if you were a patient of Dr. X,

           10     you were 940 times more likely to have an infection?

           11     A.  Yes, that ratio speaks for itself.  9.4, very high.

           12     Q.  But I want to be clear your understanding of an odds

           13     ratio is that if it's 9.4, it means your chances of getting

           14     infection in this case would be 940 times than if you didn't

           15     have that surgeon?

           16     A.  Well, we didn't do that kind of calculation on this one.

           17     Q.  Okay.  Doctor, is it really with an odds ratio or

           18     relative risk is?

           19     A.  What's that?

           20     Q.  Is it really 940 times when it's a relative risk of 9.4?

           21     A.  It's 9.4 times.

           22     Q.  Not 940?

           23     A.  Correct.

           24     Q.  And out of 3.8 relative risk is not 380 times, it's --

           25     A.  3.8 times.




                                                                             697



            1     Q.  Yeah, okay.  Thank you for clarifying that.

            2               Now, when you did this investigation, you reviewed

            3     all the medical records, right, you and your team?

            4     A.  Well, Dr. Gordon and the team reviewed the medical

            5     records from the group of patients that are involved in the

            6     study, yes.

            7     Q.  I feel like I'm at a family reunion.  The first author

            8     is Steven Gordon, right?

            9     A.  There you go.

           10     Q.  I have no idea who he is and he's no relation to me.

           11     All these Gordons running around.

           12               Okay.  So when Dr. Gordon reviewed these records,

           13     he, as I counted it, he looked for 30 different things.  And

           14     if you want to follow along with me, if you don't -- I

           15     wouldn't expect you to recall off the top of your head.

           16               I think it starts off on page 2 in the second

           17     column, the bottom paragraph.  It says, "medical records of

           18     the study patients were reviewed for," it goes on to say.

           19     So I guess Dr. Gordon would have been looking for the age of

           20     the patients, right?  Their sex.  I'm just going to go

           21     through the list quickly because I want to come back and ask

           22     about a couple of things, just so the jury understands when

           23     doing this study on behalf of the CDC, you and your

           24     colleagues looked at -- I want them to understand what you

           25     looked at when the medical records were reviewed.




                                                                             698



            1               So it was age, sex, etiology of underlying joint

            2     disease, prior knee surgery, the ASA score, that's one of

            3     the things we'll come back to because that doesn't

            4     necessarily mean anything right now.  The preoperative, we

            5     won't come back to it so can you explain to the jury what

            6     that is?

            7     A.  When you drop your voice, I can't hear you.  You're

            8     reading them I can see that.

            9     Q.  I'm sorry.  That's better.  We'll back up, so when

           10     you're reviewing, your team was reviewing the records, you

           11     looked at age; right?

           12     A.  Correct.

           13     Q.  Sex?

           14     A.  Correct.

           15     Q.  Etiology of the underlying joint disease?

           16     A.  Correct.

           17     Q.  Prior knee surgery?

           18     A.  Correct.

           19     Q.  An ASA score?

           20     A.  Correct.

           21     Q.  Preoperative hematocrit?

           22     A.  Correct.

           23     Q.  I'm never going to talk about it again, so let's quick

           24     tell the jury what it is?

           25     A.  What an hematocrit is?




                                                                             699



            1     Q.  Yes.

            2     A.  It's a measure of your red blood cells in your blood.

            3     Q.  Steroid use?

            4     A.  Correct.

            5     Q.  Presence of diabetes?

            6     A.  Correct.

            7     Q.  Use of insulin?

            8     A.  Correct.

            9     Q.  Evidence of nosocomial infections?

           10     A.  Correct.

           11     Q.  You explained what that was yesterday.  Which operating

           12     room the surgeries were performed in, right?

           13     A.  Correct.

           14     Q.  The time of day that the surgery was performed, right?

           15     A.  Correct.

           16     Q.  The type of prosthetic implants, the specific

           17     manufacturer and device model, right?

           18     A.  It doesn't say manufacturer, but the type of knee

           19     implanted, yes.

           20     Q.  And whether that was cemented or cementless, how it was

           21     attached to the bone?

           22     A.  Yes.

           23     Q.  The number of personnel in the operating room, right?

           24     A.  During a surgical procedure.

           25     Q.  Intraoperative irrigation?




                                                                             700



            1     A.  Correct.

            2     Q.  Duration of postoperative wound drains?

            3     A.  Correct.

            4     Q.  Use of antimicrobial prophylaxis, which is a tongue

            5     twister way of saying pre-op antibiotics, right?

            6     A.  Sometimes intra-op as well.

            7     Q.  Okay.  And prophylaxis means to protect, right?

            8     A.  But if it's a long procedure, and it goes beyond the

            9     half life of the antibiotic, it's redosed.

           10     Q.  Right, but I mean it's not -- when the antibiotics are

           11     given prophylactically that means that it's to prevent

           12     against something not to treat an already existing

           13     infection?

           14     A.  Correct.

           15     Q.  The time from the first incision to when the procedure

           16     is over?

           17     A.  Well, it's actually it says the time from the first dose

           18     of antimicrobial prophylaxis to skin incision.

           19     Q.  I'm sorry.  In other words, the time that that

           20     preoperative protective antibiotic was given until the first

           21     incision was made?

           22     A.  Right, was it given in a timely fashion?

           23     Q.  The duration of the surgery?

           24     A.  The operation from skin incision to closure, yes.

           25     Q.  The duration of the use of an intraoperative limb




                                                                             701



            1     tourniquet?

            2     A.  Yes.

            3     Q.  Whether preoperative shaving was used?

            4     A.  It says just preoperative shaving.

            5     Q.  Okay.  And this -- the things that were being studied

            6     here were kind of in the 1984 to 1987, right?

            7     A.  They were what?

            8     Q.  The study period for this or the period that you were

            9     looking at was 1984 to 1987, right?

           10     A.  1984 to 1987, yes.

           11     Q.  And back in those days, the -- it was standard of care,

           12     common practice at least, to shave the operative site,

           13     right?

           14     A.  Probably, yeah.

           15     Q.  And in fact, one of the things that changed particularly

           16     when your 1999 guidelines came out was, hey, let's not do

           17     any more shaving.  You talked about it a little bit

           18     yesterday, but now you just clip hair, right?

           19     A.  Right.

           20     Q.  But this was back in those days when you did shaving,

           21     right?

           22     A.  Correct.

           23     Q.  And then the name of the surgeon, right?

           24     A.  Correct.

           25     Q.  And use of a continuous passive odor machine?




                                                                             702



            1     A.  Correct.

            2     Q.  Can you tell us what that would have been?

            3     A.  It's basically a machine that depending on let's say you

            4     had elbow surgery where it would move your arm or your leg

            5     or your hip because there was some suggestive data that the

            6     more quickly you start engaging the muscles and the tendons

            7     and working around where the surgical procedure was, the

            8     better off you are.

            9     Q.  So basically kind of a mechanical thing that would move

           10     in this case the leg?

           11     A.  The leg.

           12     Q.  Okay.  Are those things used anymore?

           13     A.  I don't believe so.

           14     Q.  Okay.

           15     A.  They get people up walking around instead.

           16     Q.  And you looked at the duration of any postoperative

           17     fever?

           18     A.  Correct.

           19     Q.  You looked at the duration of antibiotic administration,

           20     right?

           21     A.  Duration of antimicrobial exposure or administration,

           22     yes.

           23     Q.  I was trying to use simpler words, but it's basically

           24     antibiotics, right?

           25     A.  We want to be complete.




                                                                             703



            1     Q.  Okay.  And the time from the surgery to the time there

            2     was a documentation of infection, right?

            3     A.  It actually says the time from the total knee

            4     arthroplasty procedure to documentation of surgical

            5     infection.

            6     Q.  Okay.  And then the culture results?

            7     A.  Wound culture results.

            8     Q.  And the time from that initial arthroplasty to any

            9     reoperation, right?

           10     A.  Time from the total knee arthroplasty procedure to

           11     initial reoperation for cases, yes.

           12     Q.  So you had all those medical records, you reviewed those

           13     all and went through all those 30 things, but you didn't

           14     stop there, right?  You went to the hospitals, right?

           15     A.  Well, this was done while at the hospital.  That's part

           16     of the CDC investigation is on site.

           17     Q.  And, well, you interviewed the operating room nurses at

           18     both hospitals, right?

           19     A.  Correct.

           20     Q.  You asked them to describe the operating room practices

           21     associated with the total knee arthroplasties, right?

           22     A.  Correct.

           23     Q.  You even interviewed the nurse managers on the

           24     orthopedic floors, right?

           25     A.  Correct.




                                                                             704



            1     Q.  You interviewed the personnel from the physical

            2     rehabilitation department, right?

            3     A.  Correct.

            4     Q.  And these are people that would have only -- the

            5     physical rehab people would have been people only involved

            6     in post-surgical care, right?

            7     A.  Well, they were involved with that continuous motion

            8     machine.

            9     Q.  And that continuous motion machine was something that

           10     was only used after the surgery, right?

           11     A.  Correct.

           12     Q.  Okay.  You interviewed the preoperative shaving team

           13     personnel, right?

           14     A.  Correct.

           15     Q.  As a former orderly, I just want to say I appreciate a

           16     much better title.  In those days, that would have been an

           17     orderly, right?

           18     A.  Probably.

           19     Q.  And you asked the rehab people, you asked for detailed

           20     description of their activities, right?  Actually, I think

           21     that was for everybody listed.  You were interviewing them

           22     for detailed descriptions of activities associated with

           23     patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty, right?

           24     A.  Correct.

           25     Q.  You also interviewed several orthopedic surgeons, right?




                                                                             705



            1     A.  Correct.

            2     Q.  And you even observed four surgeries by three different

            3     surgeons.  So two of the surgeons you observed once, and one

            4     surgeon twice, right?

            5     A.  Correct.

            6     Q.  Then you did a whole bunch of statistical tests trying

            7     to look at the impact of various, all these things that you

            8     pulled together to see if anything seemed to stand out as

            9     having a potential for having been a contributing factor to

           10     why it appeared that doctor X had such a high rate of

           11     surgery, right?

           12     A.  Rate of infection.

           13     Q.  Rate of infection.  Thank you.  And I don't want to get

           14     too weedy here, but you did something called univariate

           15     analysis and then multivariate analysis on all these

           16     different factors, right?

           17     A.  Correct.

           18     Q.  And what emerged from that was that it turned out that

           19     well, yeah, it did appear that Dr. X had a higher rate of

           20     infections, but it also turned out that Dr. X had a higher

           21     proportion of patients with an ASA score of 3 or greater; is

           22     that right?

           23     A.  Yes.

           24     Q.  Now, let's talk about ASA.  Can you tell the jury what

           25     ASA score refers to?




                                                                             706



            1     A.  ASA score is a kind of a gross assessment by an

            2     anesthesiologist that they make before the surgical

            3     procedure, so they look at what underlying diseases you

            4     have, do you have cardiac disease?  Do you have diabetes?

            5     Are you obese, blah, blah, blah, and then make an assessment

            6     of kind of what your risk that something bad is going to

            7     happen during surgery?  So, and then they score it 1, 2, 3

            8     or 4.

            9               And, generally, studies have shown that

           10     anesthesiologists kind of upgrade the ASA because then if I

           11     give you an ASA of 1 and you die in the operating room,

           12     we're going to probably be in a setting like this.  On the

           13     other hand, if I give you a 3, and you die during the

           14     surgery -- uh, I said you were sick.

           15     Q.  On the initial analysis, you found some other things

           16     besides that ASA score that looked like they might

           17     potentially be contributing to the apparent increase in

           18     Dr. X's infection rate, right?

           19     A.  Correct.

           20     Q.  There appeared to be some significant differences in

           21     terms of operation time.  Dr. X's appeared to be shorter,

           22     and the amount of time that the tourniquet was on during the

           23     surgery, right?

           24     A.  I presume you're talking now about the univariate

           25     analysis not the multivariate analysis?




                                                                             707



            1     Q.  Exactly.  Thank you for clarifying.

            2               Yes, on this univariate analysis, and so the jury

            3     understands this, you're just comparing one thing to

            4     another, right?  Just looking at one factor?

            5     A.  One factor at a time between the exposed and the

            6     non-exposed, yes.

            7     Q.  So in that univariate analysis, you identified -- let's

            8     see if I'm right, it was eight things, but one of them was

            9     shorter operation time and a shorter tourniquet time, right?

           10     A.  I get ten things, but we'll give you eight if you want.

           11     Q.  Why don't you tell me what they were because I --

           12     A.  A mean duration operation, mean duration tourniquet

           13     application, use of the passive motion, continuous passive

           14     motion machine, and then continuous passive motion by not

           15     using it versus using, breaking it into categories.  Mean

           16     onset, so when do they start using the continuous passive

           17     motion machine?  A mean duration of continuous machine, and

           18     the time of the operation, timely administration of

           19     prophylactic antibiotics, ASA class greater equal to 3, and

           20     assisted surgery.

           21     Q.  Was there a less frequent use of a timely administration

           22     of antibiotics?

           23     A.  Surgeon X had less timely administration of prophylactic

           24     antibiotics.

           25     Q.  And this is on that univariate analysis where you only




                                                                             708



            1     look at one variable, right?

            2     A.  Correct.

            3     Q.  After you identified those ten things, then you, and by

            4     you I mean whoever did the statistical analysis, maybe it

            5     was you, took those ten things and ran them through

            6     something called a multivariate analysis, right?

            7     A.  Correct.  I don't think all ten of them were, but

            8     subsets of the ten were.

            9     Q.  Okay, and when you did that, there were three things

           10     that you concluded had a strong association with infection?

           11     A.  Correct.

           12     Q.  Number one was Dr. X, right?

           13     A.  Correct.

           14     Q.  But number two was an ASA score of 3 or greater, right?

           15     A.  Correct.

           16     Q.  Number three was a weaker association, but it appeared

           17     that if he started, if the passive range motion machine he

           18     seemed -- he didn't use it as much as the other surgeons,

           19     but when he did use it, he put it, he started it earlier,

           20     the first day after surgery as opposed to later; is that

           21     right?

           22     A.  Correct, yes.

           23     Q.  So you identified all those things and that was

           24     important, wasn't it, because if you just looked at the raw

           25     numbers, the numbers prompted the hospital to call you at




                                                                             709



            1     the CDC in the first place, you would have said, hey, this

            2     surgeon, we got to pull his license.  He's way off the

            3     charts; right?

            4     A.  I'm not sure what the question is.  Surgeon X ended up

            5     being statistically significant at the end.  So, yeah, they

            6     could have done that at the very beginning, saved a lot of

            7     time.

            8     Q.  Wasn't that same 9.4 relative risk, was it?

            9     A.  What's that?

           10     Q.  Once you done all this careful thorough analysis and you

           11     found out that the ASA, he had statistically significant

           12     larger group of patients or more patients with an ASA

           13     satisfactory score of 3 or greater, then his, the risk

           14     attributed to that particular surgeon, that went down,

           15     didn't it?

           16     A.  Slightly, but still it's statistically significant.

           17     Q.  So is the ASA score of 3 or greater, right?

           18     A.  Correct.

           19     Q.  What was Mr. Gareis' ASA score?

           20     A.  3.

           21     Q.  And on the whole study design, your whole approach to

           22     doing this, you looked at a whole bunch of factors and then

           23     tested each one of them through what's called an univariate

           24     analysis, right?

           25     A.  Correct.




                                                                             710



            1     Q.  And once you had done that, you took the ones that

            2     looked on the surface like or not on the surface but on that

            3     initial statistical test, looked like you might have the

            4     potential for being associated with the increased risk, and

            5     you ran them through a multivariate analysis where multiple

            6     variables were considered, right?

            7     A.  Correct.

            8     Q.  And then some of those things on univariate analysis

            9     appear to not be or initially appeared to potentially be

           10     significant dropped out, right?

           11     A.  Correct.

           12     Q.  And what was left after you had done the multivariate

           13     analysis, the univariate analysis of all these multiple

           14     variables, you had Dr. X's ASA score of 3 or greater and

           15     weak association of early use of the passive motion machine,

           16     right?

           17     A.  Well, the final model was just the two.

           18     Q.  Okay.  But you did mention that the -- that's right, you

           19     said the increased risk was surgeon X was confined to

           20     patients with ASA class greater than 3.

           21               REPORTER:  I'm sorry?

           22     Q.  Sorry.  You ultimately concluded that the increased risk

           23     of surgical wound infection associated with surgeon X was

           24     confined to patients with ASA class greater than 3, right?

           25     A.  Correct.




                                                                             711



            1     Q.  Okay.  Now, one of the things you found in this study,

            2     and this is on page 912 of the paper itself under

            3     preoperative shaving, you found that there was no

            4     association between preoperative shaving at this time and

            5     risk of total knee arthroplasty associated surgical wound

            6     infections; is that right?

            7     A.  Correct.

            8     Q.  But based on that, you didn't conclude, okay, we've

            9     established that shaving is not a problem, go ahead and do

           10     it hence forth and forever more, right?

           11     A.  You mean as a general recommendation?

           12     Q.  Yeah.

           13     A.  Well, and I think that's why you should be looking at

           14     procedures specific data rather than general data.

           15     Obviously, your knee doesn't have a lot of hair on it.

           16     Q.  Well, today, do the recommendations -- well, not even

           17     today -- back in 1999, when you did the CDC recommendations,

           18     did you say don't shave in this group of procedures, but

           19     it's okay to shave in knee arthroplasty?

           20     A.  No, because of the theoretically risk of nicking the

           21     skin.

           22     Q.  But your study showed that it wasn't a risk in that one

           23     study?

           24     A.  In this particular study in these patients it was not.

           25     Q.  But there were other studies that showed actually was a




                                                                             712



            1     risk, right, in other procedures?

            2     A.  Particularly cardiac, yes.

            3     Q.  So it was -- you generalized that to all procedures.

            4     You didn't just say, well, hey, this study shows no

            5     advantage to not shaving so, you know, we just won't apply

            6     to any arthroplasty?

            7     A.  Well, I guess I would categorize that by saying there

            8     are more studies showing that shaving led to increased risk

            9     of infection than studies that showed it did not.

           10     Q.  Okay.  Even though your studies showed shaving was not a

           11     risk for knee arthroplasty in this study of this group

           12     population of patients, other studies in other procedures

           13     became so clear that shaving, it's not a good thing, that

           14     that became the standard of care probably earlier than 1999,

           15     right?  At least by the time you came out with the CDC

           16     infection or SSI guidelines, right?

           17     A.  Correct, in 1999.

           18     Q.  So one study that doesn't find a risk with something

           19     doesn't mean that you don't ever have to consider that in,

           20     in the future, right?

           21     A.  Well, you need to look at the pathogenic mechanism and

           22     the logic of it as well as all the data.

           23     Q.  And If the pathogenic mechanism and logic of it is

           24     determined from cardiac surgeries or neurosurgery or hip

           25     fracture repair or some other type of surgery, if the




                                                                             713



            1     pathogenic mechanisms make sense, do you have to go and

            2     study the particular thing in every single type of surgery

            3     before you say, you know what, it's a good idea not to shave

            4     patients?

            5     A.  Well, I think you need to look at the specific situation

            6     and see -- to answer that.  Some cases it might be

            7     generalized, in others it might not be.

            8     Q.  Okay.  Now, I want to draw your attention to the

            9     discussion on page 913.

           10     A.  915?

           11     Q.  913, sorry.

           12     A.  Okay.

           13     Q.  You said in this paper, and by the way, this was a

           14     published peer review paper, right, in the American Journal

           15     of Epidemiology, right?

           16     A.  Correct.

           17     Q.  And you didn't routinely publish all of your

           18     investigations for the CDC, did you, in peer reviewed

           19     journals?

           20     A.  In my 17 years, we published almost one hundred percent.

           21     Q.  Okay.  But is it fair to say you were proud of this

           22     study?  You thought it would be helpful to the medical

           23     community?

           24     A.  Correct.

           25     Q.  Okay.  Now, in the discussion you said this




                                                                             714



            1     investigation of total knee arthroplasty associated -- I'm

            2     going to slow down and start again and slowly.

            3               "This investigation of total knee arthroplasty

            4     associated surgical wound infections emphasizes the

            5     complexity of investigating clusters of infections

            6     associated with surgery and the importance of careful

            7     analysis.  If the interpretation of differences in infection

            8     rates among surgeons is to be meaningful."  Did I get that

            9     right?

           10     A.  Correct.

           11     Q.  And is there anything about total knee arthroplasty that

           12     would make it more complex in terms of investigating

           13     clusters than a hip arthroplasty?

           14     A.  No.

           15     Q.  Okay.  And since 1990, nothing has changed to

           16     investigate hip arthro -- hip joint infections.  It's

           17     complex, isn't it?

           18     A.  Well, I guess I would say you've asked several things

           19     there.  In terms of nothing has changed, that's definitely

           20     wrong.  Many of the things, including as we talked about use

           21     of the passive machine has changed, skin prep has changed,

           22     ventilation systems have changed.  There's a lot of things

           23     that have changed.

           24     Q.  It's still -- investigating the causes of joint

           25     infections is still complex, isn't it?




                                                                             715



            1     A.  Yes.

            2     Q.  Okay.  Now, in this particular study, you didn't just

            3     read the medical records and draw conclusions, did you?

            4     A.  Well, the difference is this is a group of patients

            5     having infections as a cluster and an outbreak versus in

            6     one.  Those are very different approaches.  As I told you

            7     when you were talking about protocol, there was no protocol

            8     for this.  There was no two outbreaks that we ever

            9     investigated during my 17 years that we did the same thing.

           10     You tailor it to the situation.

           11               When we investigated the first outbreak of

           12     vancomycin intermediate resistance staphylococcus aureus,

           13     never had happened in the history of the world.  There was

           14     one.  Did we do this kind of data analysis on 50 patients?

           15     No.  We did a deep dive on one patient.  So it depends on

           16     the situation and what you're investigating.

           17     Q.  And in that one patient, which was it

           18     vancomycin resistant staph aureus, was it?

           19     A.  Vancomycin intermediate resistant, the first time it

           20     ever happened in the world, staph aureus.

           21     Q.  And how did you go about investigating that?

           22     A.  We sent a team just like we did here and reviewed the

           23     medical record.

           24     Q.  Did you do anything else?  Did they do anything else?

           25     A.  Yes, we looked at the organism in the laboratory, did




                                                                             716



            1     genetic studies on that or organism to determine how and why

            2     it had become vancomycin intermediate resistant and then

            3     made recommendations based upon that.

            4     Q.  Did you do any sampling in any of the physical areas of

            5     the hospital?

            6     A.  No.

            7     Q.  Did you do any testing or sampling of the personnel?

            8     A.  No.

            9     Q.  Just looked at the medical records and the lab reports?

           10     A.  When I say we got the isolates and did studies of the

           11     isolates as well.

           12     Q.  What do you mean by "isolates?"

           13     A.  The vancomycin intermediate staph aureus strain, the

           14     bug.

           15     Q.  And that was so that was a laboratory analysis?

           16     A.  Well, the laboratory studies were, yes.

           17     Q.  And, I'm sorry, did you see say that it was genome type

           18     or genetic --

           19     A.  Genome typing?

           20     Q.  The strain, how did you -- what was it you were looking

           21     at in the lab report?

           22     A.  We did extended antibiograms.  We did electromicroscopy.

           23     We did genetic typing of it.

           24     Q.  Genetic typing is what I -- and why were you doing that?

           25     What was the purpose of trying to find that out?




                                                                             717



            1     A.  The purpose was to describe to the world that this

            2     antibiotic resistance was emerging and it was associated

            3     with the increasing use of vancomycin, and that if this

            4     continued to become more resistant, we would have

            5     vancomycin resistant staphylococcus aureus, which would be a

            6     public health emergency.

            7     Q.  So the concern was that up until that point no one had

            8     ever seen a staph aureus bug that couldn't be killed by

            9     vancomycin, is that right?

           10     A.  Correct.

           11     Q.  And when you found one that couldn't be killed or didn't

           12     respond as staph aureus had done before, your focus was on

           13     the bacteria or the bacterium itself, right?

           14     A.  And the patient.

           15     Q.  Why were you looking at the patient in that case?

           16     A.  Because the patient was receiving dialysis, the patient

           17     was getting vancomycin exposure repeatedly.  And that was

           18     very important for the emergence of vancomycin resistant

           19     enterococcus.  It results not from basically transferred

           20     genetics but rather because of repeated exposure to

           21     vancomycin, it increased the size of its cell walls, so

           22     vancomycin could not penetrate it.

           23               REPORTER:  I'm sorry, would you slow down?

           24     "Basically transferred genetics."

           25     A.  So exposure to vancomycin caused the cell wall to expand




                                                                             718



            1     so that vancomycin could not penetrate it.

            2     Q.  Were you ever called in to investigate the cause of a

            3     staph, a single staph epidermidis infection when you were at

            4     the CDC?

            5     A.  I can't say that we were never called about it, but we

            6     never went out on an investigation such as that.

            7     Q.  When you were at the CDC, if a hospital had called you

            8     and you said, hey, one of our patients got a staph

            9     epidermidis joint infection several years ago, what do you

           10     think caused it?  What would you have done?

           11     A.  We probably would have referred them to the literature

           12     and given them some advice on what they could look at.  We

           13     got probably five hundred phone calls a day, ten percent of

           14     those would be quote clusters or outbreaks.  We did not have

           15     the personnel to be sending someone out using your tax

           16     dollars every time someone called.

           17     Q.  Well, in terms of investigating a single -- a single

           18     case of an infection of a very common bacteria several years

           19     after the fact, there really would be no way to do an

           20     investigation that would identify where it came from, right?

           21     A.  Well, you certainly could do what was done here.  We ran

           22     a medical record and determine what's more likely than not.

           23     Q.  Okay.  Well, in the case of this surgeon situation, just

           24     looking at the medical records, you could have figured out

           25     all these things, right?




                                                                             719



            1     A.  Probably.

            2     Q.  So why did you do all those interviews with doctors and

            3     nurses and physical therapists and the orderlies, visit the

            4     OR, why do that if you could have just read the medical

            5     records?

            6     A.  Well, the hospital epidemiologist Brian Simmons in the

            7     article basically thought that when he called us in, but

            8     they were going to have to deal with an orthopedic surgeon

            9     and wanted to have as much information as they could to make

           10     that decision.

           11     Q.  Would you agree that the jury ought to have as much

           12     information as they can before they make their decision as

           13     to what caused Mr. Gareis' infection?

           14     A.  Oh, absolutely.

           15     Q.  Okay.  Now, going back to the Dr. X paper on page 914.

           16     In the first full paragraph you say, "there were several

           17     limitations to our investigation that may have influenced

           18     our findings."  And the first one you list is "quantitative

           19     and unbiased methods of assessing surgical procedures which

           20     include preoperative preparation, intraoperative technique,

           21     and postoperative care have not been developed," did I read

           22     that correctly?

           23     A.  I'm trying to find where you're reading.

           24     Q.  Sorry, page 914.

           25     A.  I've got that.




                                                                             720



            1     Q.  Right hand column?

            2     A.  Okay.

            3     Q.  First paragraph.

            4     A.  Second paragraph.

            5     Q.  Sorry.  First full paragraph.  Second paragraph.

            6     A.  Okay.  Yep.  Correct.

            7     Q.  Let's translate that into something we can all

            8     understand.  What does it mean to have quantitative and

            9     unbiased methods of assessing surgical procedures?  Let's

           10     start with that.  What does it mean to have quantitative and

           11     unbiased methods of assessing surgical procedures?

           12     A.  That there's not a standardized kind of data collection

           13     tool that the people would collect data say prospectively,

           14     assessing those things you really need to do observations,

           15     so it's much more difficult retrospectively to determine

           16     them.

           17     Q.  Well, since 1990, have there been quantitative and

           18     unbiased methods of assessing surgical procedures developed?

           19     A.  No.  But, for instance, on skin prep, the Darouiche

           20     study, for example, the randomized control trial show the

           21     chlorhexidine with alcohol is far superior to povidone

           22     iodine, and you have pretty good data on how effective

           23     chlorhexidine with alcohol is, how effective the

           24     chlorhexidine bathing is beforehand in reducing the

           25     organism, transferring organisms on the skin.  So we have




                                                                             721



            1     much better interventions in those areas now so the

            2     quantitation, even though they're still not quantitative

            3     methods, we know that what is done is much better.

            4     Q.  When you say quantitative methods, are you saying if the

            5     medical records say chlorhexidine prep administered, that

            6     checks the box and means that it was administered adequately

            7     and in a timely manner and applied in the proper and correct

            8     way?

            9     A.  Well, you hope that it was in the training, but

           10     certainly if you have chlorhexidine bathing the night

           11     before, chlorhexidine bathing the day of, use of alcohol as

           12     a skin prep, and then use chlorhexidine with alcohol as a

           13     skin prep, you've got four times that you've tried to

           14     decrease the transient flora, the likelihood that there is

           15     20 percent of the transient flora is still there is pretty

           16     close to zero.

           17     Q.  I'm still trying to understand what it means to be

           18     quantitative and unbiased method of assessing surgical

           19     procedures.  Let's skip the preoperative prep, because I

           20     think that's what you were talking about.

           21               Let's focus on the intraoperative technique issue.

           22     You said that that mean tissue study in 1990 was that there

           23     were no quantitative and unbiased methods for assessing

           24     intraoperative technique, right?

           25     A.  Correct.




                                                                             722



            1     Q.  What does intraoperative technique mean?

            2     A.  What the surgeons doing in particular.

            3     Q.  Surgeon skill, right?

            4     A.  Correct.

            5     Q.  And one of the things this study demonstrated, some

            6     surgeons are better than others, right?

            7     A.  Absolutely.

            8     Q.  And so if you look at, you know, gross infection rates

            9     at a hospital, without knowing, you know, is there a problem

           10     with one particular surgeon, or problem with any of the

           11     multiple variables that you looked at, it's kind of hard to

           12     determine with a univariate analysis that one thing is

           13     causing the problem?

           14     A.  Again, it depends on the situation that you're looking

           15     at.  Obviously, if you're looking at an outbreak situation,

           16     that's very different than when you're looking at endemic

           17     infections.  For instance, the CDC surveillance system that

           18     collects data on prosthetic joint infections and published

           19     them all the time, of the data that we looked at, the ten

           20     factors or 20 factors or whatever the CDC collects almost

           21     none of those.

           22               So it depends, are you doing an outbreak

           23     investigation?  Were you doing a very deep dive?  Or are you

           24     doing a surveillance system where you have more --

           25     "superficial" is not the right word, but not as deep a dive.




                                                                             723



            1     Or are you doing something in between?  So it depends on

            2     what the situation is, all are not the same.

            3     Q.  Well, would you agree that even today there's no

            4     quantitative and unbiased method for assessing a surgeon's

            5     technique?

            6     A.  I would agree with that, yes.

            7     Q.  Most surgeons, most practicing physicians think they're

            8     doing a good job, wouldn't you agree?

            9     A.  Might be speculating, I presume they think that.  And

           10     they have national benchmarks to compare themselves to and

           11     they have surveillance systems to collect their prosthetic

           12     joint infection rates.

           13     Q.  Did you ever identify what it was that surgeon X was

           14     doing wrong?

           15     A.  No.

           16     Q.  Okay.  Did the medical records ever say, you know,

           17     surgeon X came out of the surgery, and he was doing his

           18     dictation, the patient was properly prepped and draped,

           19     began the surgery, whatever, did this kind of incision and

           20     then I did something wrong?

           21     A.  Did the medical record say that he had done something

           22     wrong?

           23     Q.  Yeah.

           24     A.  I don't recall right now what all the medical records

           25     said, but I would doubt it.




                                                                             724



            1     Q.  So you identify here a problem with this particular

            2     surgeon's technique, but you would agree with me that it's

            3     pretty likely that he wasn't even perhaps aware of it, but

            4     he certainly wasn't documenting in the medical records,

            5     well, I screwed up on this?

            6     A.  Well, as I say, I don't remember the medical records

            7     what 15, 20 years later, but I would doubt that.

            8     Q.  And the other thing you were talking about is you had no

            9     method for assessing the postoperative care.  And in this

           10     case, you started to find some issue with this passive range

           11     of motion machine, but then you found it didn't quite reach

           12     statistical significance, right?

           13     A.  Correct.  The problem was intraoperative.

           14     Q.  I'm sorry?

           15     A.  It was intraoperative.

           16     Q.  Okay.  But why were you even looking at the passive or

           17     anything that was happening post-surgically?

           18     A.  Probably because there was some question about whether

           19     it was involved or not.

           20     Q.  How could something that happens after the wound has

           21     been sewn up in the OR be in any way related to a deep joint

           22     infection?

           23     A.  Well, it might or might not.  In this case, it wasn't.

           24     Q.  I'm trying to understand the mechanism of how it might

           25     have been.




                                                                             725



            1     A.  Well, I guess one possibility hypothetically could be

            2     that the person that is putting on the device doesn't know

            3     what they're doing, doesn't put it on right, and they expand

            4     the joint too far and cause damage.  We didn't see the

            5     evidence of that.  And as I say, the continuous passive

            6     motion machine did not end up being statistically

            7     significant.

            8     Q.  Are there things that can happen once a joint

            9     replacement patient is sewn up in the OR, start wheeling him

           10     or her out, are there things that can happen from that point

           11     that can cause a deep joint infection?

           12     A.  From that point forever or that point in the next five

           13     days?

           14     Q.  Let's say the next five days?

           15     A.  Sure, they can fall out of bed and break their hip

           16     again.

           17     Q.  That would probably be reflected in the medical records,

           18     right?

           19     A.  I would sure hope.

           20     Q.  Is there anything else?

           21     A.  They could have a urinary catheter and have it in too

           22     long and get a urinary tract infection and a secondary

           23     bloodstream infection and seed the wound.  They could have

           24     an intravascular catheter and get a bloodstream infection

           25     and seed the wound.




                                                                             726



            1     Q.  Can dressings effect the possibility of getting a joint

            2     infection after the wound has been sewn up?

            3     A.  Certainly.  It would be one of those one in a million

            4     things, not commonly, no.

            5     Q.  Okay.

            6     A.  Usually, the dressing is placed and by the time they

            7     take the dressing off, the wound is largely healed.

            8     Q.  We'll get to it in a little bit here, but one of the

            9     things your 1999 guidelines addressed was the type of

           10     closure.  In other words, how he closed that wound in the

           11     surgery.  Do you recall that?  Different ways of closing

           12     wounds?

           13     A.  Right, talked about sutures, sure.

           14     Q.  Do you remember that you recommended any one type over

           15     another?

           16     A.  I'd have to go back and look at that, and certainly it

           17     was very different in the 2000s than the 1999 guideline.

           18     Q.  You know, actually this question I should have asked

           19     earlier.  When is the last time you actually treated a

           20     patient?

           21     A.  I guess it depends on what you mean by "treat a

           22     patient."  I don't do clinical practice right now, so I'm

           23     not treating individual patients but in my consulting

           24     practice, I definitely go into surgery centers and do

           25     observations of the surgical procedure as well as a




                                                                             727



            1     postoperative care and make recommendations.

            2     Q.  I'm speaking specifically of a clinical practice, when

            3     is the last time you actually treated an individual?

            4     A.  The last time I had a clinical practice was in 2003.

            5     Q.  I was a little confused by that because I thought I

            6     heard you yesterday speaking in the present tense about when

            7     you treat a patient, but I'm glad you cleared that up.

            8               Now, when you -- in 2003, where would you have

            9     been treating individual patients?

           10     A.  I was on the faculty at Emory University School of

           11     Medicine.

           12     Q.  So you would be called in as a consultant?

           13     A.  Correct.

           14     Q.  I mean you didn't have like an office and people would

           15     come to see Dr. Jarvis?

           16     A.  Correct.

           17     Q.  Okay.

           18     A.  Well, we had an outpatient clinic that we could be at,

           19     but I did not have a private office, no.

           20     Q.  And would you say that you were almost always called in

           21     by another doctor who needed an infectious disease consult?

           22     A.  Correct.

           23     Q.  And were you consulting on both adults and children?

           24     A.  Mostly children, but adolescence, and we -- remember we

           25     went over this in the depo, I also had some adults at the




                                                                             728



            1     internal medicine, ID docs didn't feel comfortable with.

            2     Q.  When was the last -- well, strike that.  Have you ever

            3     treated or been called in to consult in the individual

            4     treatment of an adult with a deep joint infection?

            5     A.  I certainly have gone to surgery centers and consulted,

            6     helping them deal with problems related to surgical site

            7     infections and orthopedic implant procedures, yes.

            8     Q.  I want to focus specifically on that individual

            9     treatment.  I think you heard Dr. Stonnington yesterday say

           10     that orthopedists are always involved in the treatment of

           11     joint infections.  The infectious disease doc doesn't do it

           12     on their own.  They work with the orthopedist.

           13     A.  Correct.

           14     Q.  When is the last time an orthopedist called you to do an

           15     consult on an individual adult patient with a periprosthetic

           16     joint infection?

           17     A.  It's been a while, probably years.

           18     Q.  Years, I'm sorry?

           19     A.  Right.  I'm trying to think offhand.  I got a call about

           20     an infection just yesterday, but it wasn't a joint

           21     infection, so they periodically come in.

           22     Q.  When you say they "periodically come in," where do you

           23     do the consults now?

           24     A.  Usually over the phone, sometimes by e-mail.

           25     Q.  And do you consider that being a, you know, a treating




                                                                             729



            1     doctor as opposed to just not a resource --

            2     A.  I'm not sure how you would define treating doctor.  I'm

            3     consulting and giving advice on how to treat.  For instance,

            4     the other day was to recommend that they get a gram stain

            5     and a culture and be evaluated for appropriate antibiotics.

            6     Am I in that city seeing that patient?  No.

            7     Q.  Well, do you feel like when a treating doc calls you up

            8     and says, what do you think we ought to do about this

            9     particular situation?  You say, well, why don't you try

           10     this, this, and this.  Do you think you have established a

           11     doctor/patient relationship with that patient?

           12     A.  Obviously, not.

           13     Q.  Okay.  And you wouldn't consider yourself a treating

           14     doctor, right?

           15     A.  Correct.

           16     Q.  Okay.  So using that more narrow definition perhaps,

           17     when is the last time you were a treating doctor for an

           18     adult who had a joint infection?

           19     A.  Well, as I said, the last time I did clinical hands-on

           20     consultation treating patients as a consultant in infectious

           21     disease was around 2003.

           22     Q.  And, okay, how many adult deep joint infections have you

           23     treated individually?

           24     A.  I could not tell you that.  That was rare.

           25     Q.  Less than one hundred?




                                                                             730



            1     A.  Less than one hundred, sure.

            2     Q.  Less than ten?

            3     A.  I would be guessing, probably in my career probably

            4     something like that, ten or less.

            5     Q.  Okay.  Going back to maybe referring to it as the Gordon

            6     study, but your 1990 study, you also said in the limitation

            7     section that same paragraph on 914, "Although, we observed

            8     several total knee arthroplasty procedures, we could not

            9     assess every aspect of surgical technique and other possible

           10     risk factors could not be evaluated retrospectively.  For

           11     example, the number of intraoperative glove changes, the

           12     amount of conversation and movement of personnel around the

           13     surgical field, the precision of the bone cuts and the fit

           14     of the prosthesis implant, et cetera."  Did I read that

           15     correctly?

           16     A.  Yes.

           17     Q.  Why did you consider that a limitation that you couldn't

           18     retrospectively assess things like intraoperative glove

           19     changes, the amount of conversation, the movement of

           20     personnel around the surgical field, the precision of the

           21     bone cuts, the fit of the joint, et cetera?

           22     A.  Because it was things we didn't collect.

           23     Q.  Because you couldn't figure those out from the record,

           24     right?

           25     A.  Correct.




                                                                             731



            1     Q.  And they might possibly have an impact on the issue of

            2     infection rates, right?

            3     A.  Possibly.

            4     Q.  Okay.  And the final limitation on that paragraph was

            5     you said, "we were dependent on hospital medical records so

            6     the data did not document it in these records could not be

            7     evaluated."  Did I read that correctly?

            8     A.  Correct.

            9     Q.  And you considered that a limitation of your study,

           10     right?

           11     A.  Correct.

           12     Q.  Is there anything today about medical records in general

           13     that now you're able to document data that was not recorded

           14     in the records?

           15     A.  I would say now the medical records are better just

           16     because there's more data that is collected and basically

           17     forms that need to be filled out for various regulatory and

           18     other agencies.

           19     Q.  But particularly in terms of some of those surgical

           20     technique-types things that we were talking about, that you

           21     were talking about, even today, you can't evaluate those

           22     from medical records unless they're documented, right?

           23     A.  Correct.

           24     Q.  And would you agree that it's absolutely impossible to

           25     document every conceivable thing that happens during a




                                                                             732



            1     surgery?

            2     A.  Oh, absolutely.  I would say most of the things we're

            3     saying here limitations don't exist in any of the published

            4     literature today on any study, even wonderful randomized

            5     control trial studies in New England Journal or in

            6     Dr. Kurz's study for that matter.

            7     Q.  But I'm talking about what can be documented in medical

            8     records.  Medical records can't document every single thing

            9     that might potentially be of importance?

           10     A.  Well, the key word there is potentially be of

           11     importance.  Might be, might not be.

           12     Q.  Right.  You can't evaluate it if you don't know about

           13     it, right?

           14     A.  Correct.

           15     Q.  Okay.  We put the Gordon away.

           16               I think I'm maybe able to use finally what I said

           17     I would do at the beginning, pull up Plaintiff's exhibit

           18     book for this next area of questioning.

            2               THE COURT:  Please be seated.

            3               Mr. Gordon.

            4               MR. COREY GORDON:  Thank you, Your Honor.

            5     BY MR. GORDON:

            6     Q.  Dr. Jarvis, let's switch gears now and talk about

            7     particles.  I just want to make sure that I've got it

            8     straight.

            9               You point to four articles to support your opinion

           10     that the Bair Hugger increases particles over the surgical

           11     site, right?

           12     A.  Okay.

           13     Q.  Well, let's -- we'll take them and see if I missed out

           14     on any.  The first one I want to talk about is the Legg 2011

           15     paper, Plaintiff's 94, P-94.  That would be in the

           16     plaintiff's book.  I think most of what I am going to do for

           17     the next few minutes will be in plaintiff's.

           18     A.  Okay.

           19     Q.  That's one of the studies that you rely on, right?

           20     A.  Correct.

           21     Q.  Okay.  And I want to -- forgive my handwriting, but I

           22     want to do something similar to what plaintiff's counsel

           23     did.  I want to, first of all, have a column for number of

           24     patients.  Sorry, I'm an overhead transparency guy.  And

           25     let's do a column for particle size.  And let's do a column



                                        
                                                             
                                                                             734


            1     for whether bacteria -- the presence of bacteria was

            2     assessed, and what the study says about causation.

            3               The first one we'll start with is Legg.  We'll

            4     call that Legg 1.  Okay?  This is one of the particle

            5     studies you relied on, right?

            6     A.  Correct.

            7     Q.  Let's start with number of patients.  How many patients

            8     were involved in this study?

            9     A.  I guess it depends on if you take the volunteer as being

           10     a patient.

           11     Q.  We'll call them a patient.  So that would be one, right?

           12     A.  Correct.

           13     Q.  Looked at three different particle sizes, right?

           14     A.  0.3, 0.5, and 5 microns.

           15     Q.  0.3, 0.5, and 5.  We'll agree those are microns.

           16               The increase in number of 0.3 micron particles

           17     from the Bair Hugger over no Bair Hugger, using that as a

           18     control, that would be 764, right?  If you take the --

           19     A.  I need a calculator, but it looks like around that.

           20     Q.  Okay.  And for the 0.5 size it would be Bair Hugger

           21     increased the number by 24.  And for the 5 micron size

           22     increased it by 2.8?

           23     A.  Right.  That's the mean number.

           24     Q.  Right, the mean number.

           25               Now, these were just --



                                        
                                                             
                                                                             735


            1     A.  None of those were statistically significant.

            2     Q.  Right.  This was just looking at the ambient background,

            3     whatever particles happened to be in that otherwise empty

            4     surgical suite, right?

            5     A.  Well, it's not empty.  It's got the volunteer, it has

            6     the forced air, the radiant heater in there, operating room

            7     table.

            8     Q.  Okay.  But no surgical personnel coming in or out?

            9     There's no machinery operating?  There's no actual surgery

           10     going on, right?

           11     A.  Correct.

           12     Q.  Okay.

           13     A.  Well, actually, there is a surgeon.  So it is an

           14     assimilated operation.

           15     Q.  Okay.  Did the surgeon use any equipment?  Did he use

           16     the --

           17     A.  Wore sterile clothing, a theater hood, and body exhaust

           18     hose.

           19     Q.  No reason to think that he was actually using a saw or a

           20     drill or a reamer or electrocautery knife, you know, the

           21     suction?

           22     A.  Correct.

           23     Q.  Just two or three bodies in there, right?

           24     A.  Correct.

           25     Q.  Okay.  Now, in the study itself does it say -- it



                                        
                                                             
                                                                             736


            1     doesn't say whether they attempted to culture bacteria or

            2     not, right?

            3     A.  That was not a part of their study.

            4     Q.  Okay.  But you know that, in fact, they did try to

            5     culture bacteria?  They couldn't find any?

            6     A.  And where does it say that?

            7     Q.  It doesn't say that, not in this paper.

            8     A.  Okay.  You learned it somewhere else?

            9     Q.  You have read Dr. Legg's deposition testimony, haven't

           10     you?

           11     A.  Long ago.

           12     Q.  Okay.

           13     A.  But certainly in the paper about their methods, their

           14     abstract, their methods say the two things they were going

           15     to do was look at the impact on temperature and look at the

           16     impact on particle.

           17     Q.  Okay.  Just to fill in my column I'm going to say -- you

           18     say not tested.

           19     A.  Well, not reported.  Not tested.

           20     Q.  Or not reported.  But I want to put an asterisk there.

           21     I'm going to ask the jury to see when they've heard all the

           22     testimony, if my memory is correct, that Dr. Legg did in

           23     fact try to culture bacteria but didn't get any.

           24               MS. CONLIN:  I'm going to object to him

           25     testifying.

            1               THE COURT:  Sustained.

            2     BY MR. COREY GORDON:

            3     Q.  If we would now move to the discussion portion on page

            4     P-0940003.  Okay?  Under Discussion, second paragraph, it

            5     says, Because of the nature of our experiment, we are unable

            6     to conclude that the use of the forced air warming device,

            7     which produced a change in temperature and an increase in

            8     the number of particles over the surgical site, would

            9     actually lead to an increased risk of surgical site

           10     infection.  And one of the reasons they explain for why they

           11     are unable to do that is they -- in the next paragraph they

           12     say that the bacteria require particles to transport them,

           13     and although we are unable to confirm if any of the

           14     particles are transporting bacteria, the significant

           15     increase in the number of particles that we found at the

           16     surgical site is of concern.

           17               So they were unable to confirm if any of the

           18     particles are transporting bacteria, but they were unable to

           19     conclude that the use of a forced air warming device, the

           20     Bair Hugger, would actually lead to an increased risk of

           21     surgical site infection, right?

           22     A.  Right, because they focused on the significant increase

           23     in temperature and the number of particles.  Right.

           24     Q.  Right.  But in my causation column you'll agree with me

           25     that they say no, this study does not show causation?



                                        
                                                             
                                                                             738


            1     A.  Right.  I guess I would say they didn't even look at it,

            2     so --

            3     Q.  Okay.  And the second one that I think you rely on,

            4     we'll call it Legg 2.  That's the Legg paper from 2013 --

            5     excuse me, 20 -- yeah, it was published in 2013, P-96.

            6     A.  Oh, P-96.  Which one is that?  I have P-94 and then D,

            7     like dog, 96.

            8     Q.  There is a D-96 in the book, but the very next one is

            9     P-96.

           10     A.  Got it.

           11     Q.  I'm guessing under the Patients column you want to put

           12     1, right?

           13     A.  Excuse me?

           14     Q.  Under the Patients column 1 because this was a -- or was

           15     there?

           16     A.  Correct.

           17     Q.  Well, they say it was a mannequin.

           18     A.  There is a surgeon, too.

           19     Q.  But I'm just counting patients the way you were counting

           20     patients.

           21     A.  Oh, okay.

           22     Q.  I'll do whatever you want.  If you want to count a

           23     mannequin as a patient, I'll do it.

           24     A.  It's up to you.  I don't care.

           25     Q.  You tell me.  I'll give you the mannequin.



                                        
                                                             
                                                                             739


            1               Okay.  What was the particle size?

            2     A.  What was that?

            3     Q.  What was the particle size?  Let me speed this up.  Look

            4     at the bottom of the first column on page 0002 where it says

            5     it can measure --

            6     A.  Greater than 0.3 microns.

            7     Q.  How were the particles generated?  This wasn't just

            8     ambient particles, right?  Top of that column.  I directed

            9     you to the wrong place.  Measuring device was at the bottom.

           10     But what the particles were is at the top of that column.

           11     A.  They were created by a Rocket PS 23 smoke machine.

           12     Q.  So it was a smoke generator, a fog?

           13     A.  Correct.

           14     Q.  And it was blowing out particles of what size?

           15     A.  0.3 microns.

           16     Q.  Okay.  And blowing out these particles from this machine

           17     there was an increase of -- it was huge, a couple million

           18     over -- yeah, over 2 million over control, right?

           19     A.  It used a what?

           20     Q.  There was a huge increase over the control using this

           21     smoke generator.  With a Bair Hugger on versus Bair Hugger

           22     off there were more than 2 million more particles, right?

           23     A.  Correct.

           24     Q.  This says nothing about bacteria, right?

           25     A.  They did not look.



                                        
                                                             
                                                                             740


            1     Q.  Okay.  And on this one under Causation it says -- if you

            2     turn to the last page, page 0004 -- This study does not show

            3     that forced air warming increases the risk of infection,

            4     only that in certain types of theater set-up it can

            5     significantly disrupt the unidirectional airflow and draw

            6     particles from the potentially contaminated area below the

            7     sterile field -- sterile surgical field.  So on causation

            8     that's a no, right?

            9     A.  And they say this is a concern.

           10     Q.  Right.  But they don't conclude that there's any

           11     causation?

           12     A.  Well, they didn't look at SSIs.  Yes.

           13     Q.  Okay.  For Sessler, that's P-75.  And this is the study

           14     in the Netherlands, right?

           15     A.  Correct.

           16     Q.  And the purpose of this test wasn't to measure absolute

           17     numbers of particles, right?

           18     A.  Well, it was looking at particle reduction, the DIN

           19     standard.

           20     Q.  I think you used the term "relative" impact on the

           21     unidirectional airflow.  Right?

           22     A.  Correct.

           23     Q.  And without the unidirectional airflow on, it started

           24     out with 35 million particles, however they were measuring

           25     it.  When they turned the laminar airflow system on, that 35



                                        
                                                             
                                                                             741


            1     million went down to under 1,000 when the Bair Hugger upper

            2     body blanket was used, the one that was used in Mr. Gareis'

            3     surgery, right?

            4     A.  Repeat that, please.

            5     Q.  Why don't you look at figure 2.

            6     A.  I am.

            7     Q.  Okay.  And that's a logarithmic scale, right?

            8     A.  Looks like it.

            9     Q.  Which means that each space between the lines on the bar

           10     graph is a factor of 10.  So from 1 to 10 is the first jump,

           11     but then the next jump isn't from 10 to 20, it's 10 to 100.

           12     The next jump is from 100 to 1,000, the next from 1,000 to

           13     10,000, next from 10,000 to 100,000, 100,000 to a million, a

           14     million to 10 million, and so on.

           15               The baseline, the total number of particles,

           16     however they were measuring it, started out somewhere

           17     between 10 million and 100 million?

           18     A.  Correct.

           19     Q.  Kind of crude, but say it's about 30, 35 million?

           20     A.  Yeah.  I'd have to say I don't know in the paper if they

           21     ever give that exact number.

           22     Q.  I don't believe they do.  That's why I'm --

           23     A.  It's a guesstimate.

           24     Q.  Okay.  So big number, 35 million.

           25               With the system on it goes down to somewhere



                                        
                                                             
                                                                             742


            1     between 100 and 1,000?  Maybe 300?  It's hard to tell.

            2     A.  Which one are you looking at?

            3     Q.  Figure 2, the one --

            4     A.  With the no air?

            5     Q.  No air, yeah.  They just turn the machine on, whoosh, it

            6     blows out?

            7     A.  So the ambient air is what you're looking at?

            8     Q.  Well, no -- yeah, the ambient air.

            9     A.  Okay.

           10     Q.  Whoosh, it blows out all but about 2 or 300.  They turn

           11     the Bair Hugger on to not warm but just -- it's circulating

           12     and, I don't know --

           13     A.  Then the number goes up.

           14     Q.  Goes up, what, maybe charitably 100?

           15     A.  Yeah, again, they don't give a number, so it's hard to

           16     know.

           17     Q.  Okay.  And when you turn the Bair Hugger on to warm does

           18     it go up?  I can't really tell, but maybe you can.

           19     A.  It looks pretty similar to the ambient.  And this is

           20     actually particles per meters cubed.

           21     Q.  Thank you.

           22               So particles per meters cubed -- if you start out

           23     with 35 million and you go down to 2 or 300 and it goes up

           24     100 or 200, is that a meaningful difference in your view?

           25     A.  If you have a prosthetic joint inserted, it sure would



                                        
                                                             
                                                                             743


            1     be when you only need a small number of organisms.

            2     Q.  All right.  Okay.  So an increase of 100 or 200

            3     particles against the --

            4     A.  Per cubic meter.

            5     Q.  -- per cubic meter against the baseline of 35 million or

            6     so, that's your testimony.

            7               What were the size of the particles?

            8               You'd agree with me there is no patient, right?

            9     A.  Correct.  There's more mannequins, though, if we want to

           10     count mannequins.

           11     Q.  Oh, that's right, I'm giving you mannequins.

           12     A.  We've got at least three of those, maybe four.

           13     Q.  At the same time?

           14     A.  Right.  They are all standing around the table not

           15     moving.

           16     Q.  Well, but yesterday when you were -- and this morning

           17     when you were counting the patients in the studies that your

           18     plaintiff's counsel said are the 3M studies, you were just

           19     counting the patients, not the other people in the room or

           20     the other personnel.

           21     A.  Well, they didn't provide a picture and they didn't

           22     describe it, so it was hard to know if they were there or

           23     not, how many of them there were.

           24     Q.  How many patients?

           25     A.  Oh, no.  Patients --



                                        
                                                             
                                                                             744


            1     Q.  Yeah.  Yesterday for --

            2     A.  Yeah, we gave the total number of patients for each of

            3     the studies.

            4     Q.  Yesterday you came up with 64 --

            5     A.  This one is just a mannequin.

            6     Q.  Well, I'll still give it to you as a patient if you

            7     want.

            8               And particle size?

            9     A.  I'm looking to see where they have that.  I don't think

           10     they say what that is.  They indicate the size of the

           11     particles that are coming out of the generator --

           12     Q.  Yeah.

           13     A.  -- are 0.5 to 1.  But they don't -- at least I don't see

           14     it here quickly --

           15     Q.  No, that's --

           16     A.  -- indicate what they're counting.

           17     Q.  You understand that this test apparatus is set up

           18     specifically to put in a whole bunch of particles and see

           19     how -- and measure those and see how effectively the system

           20     is working?  And if it were to reduce 35 million to 350,000,

           21     it'd be working great?

           22     A.  Yeah.  I just would have expected them to say what the

           23     particles that they are measuring -- what the size is.

           24     Q.  Well, the particles they're generating to do this

           25     experiment are 0.5 to 1, right?



                                        
                                                             
                                                                             745


            1     A.  Right.

            2     Q.  Okay.  And doesn't say anything about bacteria?

            3     A.  Right.

            4     Q.  That wasn't looked at?

            5     A.  Correct.

            6     Q.  And it doesn't really directly address the issue of

            7     causation of infections.  It's addressing the issue of

            8     impact on laminar airflow.  And it concludes that it doesn't

            9     impact laminar airflow, right?

           10     A.  Well, they really talk about the protective effect and

           11     its impact on the DIN.

           12     Q.  Right.  So it's not really the same as does this cause

           13     or not cause surgical site infections.  Why don't we say

           14     that one is not addressed.

           15               The final one that I have is the McGovern 2011 at

           16     P-93.  You got that?  This is the study --

           17     A.  Yes.

           18     Q.  -- that's in two parts.  There's the observational

           19     component.  We'll talk about that separately.  But in terms

           20     of your reliance on this for your conclusion that the Bair

           21     Hugger increases particles over the surgical site, that

           22     would be the bubble part of the study, right?

           23     A.  Correct.

           24     Q.  Okay.  And what size are the bubbles?

           25     A.  They do not -- well, they say approximately 4



                                        
                                                             
                                                                             746


            1     millimeters.

            2     Q.  That's pretty big, isn't it?  How many microns are there

            3     in a millimeter?

            4     A.  I would have to calculate that.  I don't know offhand.

            5     Q.  Maybe a thousand?

            6     A.  As I say, I would have to calculate it.

            7     Q.  Okay.  But correct me --

            8     A.  We do have a mannequin.

            9     Q.  We'll give you a patient then.

           10     A.  Thank you.

           11     Q.  The particle size -- well, put that aside for a second.

           12               Your theory is based on the notion that

           13     particles -- the Bair Hugger increases particles over the

           14     surgical site based on these studies, and that, based on

           15     another study, particles are the equivalent of bacteria.

           16     We'll talk about that in greater detail.  But you're not

           17     saying that because there are more bubbles that that somehow

           18     correlates to bacteria, are you?

           19     A.  Oh, I don't think they quantitated the number of

           20     bubbles, but they did look at where the bubbles went.

           21     Q.  This is what's called an airflow visualization

           22     experiment, right?

           23     A.  Correct.  Right.

           24     Q.  They're putting these big helium bubbles out to see

           25     where they float or where the air current takes them?



                                        
                                                             
                                                                             747


            1     A.  Right, where the air current takes them, and they went

            2     over the operative field.

            3     Q.  Is it your opinion that that gives you some sort of

            4     basis for quantifying increased particles over the surgical

            5     site?

            6     A.  Well, I don't know that it -- it's qualitative, not

            7     quantitative.

            8     Q.  All right.  So is this one of the -- this part of this

            9     study, is that one of the studies you're relying on for the

           10     conclusion that Bair Hugger increases particles over the

           11     site?

           12     A.  Correct.

           13     Q.  You just can't quantify what those particles -- how many

           14     more particles or what particle size they'd be from this

           15     study?

           16     A.  Right.

           17     Q.  Okay.  Well, we'll give it to you.

           18               Now, on bacteria, you know that they -- like Legg,

           19     they actually did do a study to see if there was any

           20     bacteria that they could capture on agar plates or with a

           21     slit sampler?  You're familiar with that, aren't you?

           22     A.  You mean with the procedure?

           23     Q.  No, with the fact that the folks doing this study have

           24     done that -- have done that bacteria study first.

           25     A.  I don't see it in here.



                                        
                                                             
                                                                             748


            1     Q.  No, you don't.  You won't.

            2               Like Legg -- I'll give you a no, but I ask the

            3     jury to pay attention to the asterisk.  Okay?

            4               Now, yesterday you were asked a question that had

            5     a partial quote in the question of what these authors say

            6     about causation, but let me direct you to it on page 0007,

            7     the first full paragraph on the left column.  This study

            8     does not establish a causal basis for this association.

            9     Well, you know what, I apologize because this is merging the

           10     other part of the study that we're going to talk about

           11     separately.

           12               As far as what the bubbles show, the airflow

           13     visualization, they don't say anything, but they do go on to

           14     say that the rest of the study does not establish causal

           15     basis for this association for a variety of reasons, right?

           16     A.  I'm seeing if they said anything about the bubbles.

           17     Well, they do have a paragraph on the clinical concern

           18     regarding the formation of such convection currents.  So

           19     they at least talk about visually what the bubbles represent

           20     and what it could mean clinically.  That's on page 0006,

           21     right-hand column, whole paragraph, goes on to 007.

           22     Q.  Right.  But that same sentence segues into the

           23     observational part.

           24     A.  So I think they're in the discussion linking their

           25     visual with their clinical finding of an increased odds



                                        
                                                             
                                                                             749


            1     ratio of 3.8 for infection with a Bair Hugger and explaining

            2     how that would -- the mechanism that they're hypothesizing

            3     would cause that.

            4     Q.  Which they then go on to say that this study does not

            5     establish a causal basis?

            6     A.  Correct.

            7     Q.  So let's put "no" there.

            8               Did I miss any particle studies that you rely on?

            9     A.  You haven't mentioned Darouiche.  They do particles.

           10     Q.  Did that involve a Bair Hugger?

           11     A.  They don't say in the paper.  We know they used forced

           12     air warming, but we don't know --

           13     Q.  Did they compare forced air warming to non-forced air

           14     warming?

           15     A.  No.  But that's not necessarily the case on these

           16     either.

           17     Q.  What are they comparing?

           18     A.  Here it's turning it on and seeing what happens.  So

           19     it's not a comparative.

           20     Q.  Well --

           21     A.  And then we have Seal and Croft (sic), and Stocks.

           22     Q.  I've got to tell you I'm glad you did that because my

           23     partner is giving me a lot of grief because it's Seal and

           24     Clark, but I always refer to it as Seal and Croft.

           25     A.  There we go.  Good group.



                                        
                                                             
                                                                             750


            1     Q.  And we'll talk about Seal and Clark or Seal and Croft in

            2     a little bit.

            3     A.  Okay.  But they looked at particles, as well.

            4     Q.  And so did a lot of other researchers, right?

            5     A.  I wouldn't say a lot.  There's probably a total of five.

            6     Q.  Okay.  But in terms of what you rely on for the notion

            7     that the Bair Hugger increases particles over no Bair

            8     Hugger, Darouiche has nothing to do with that, right?

            9     A.  Correct.

           10     Q.  And yesterday you thought Stocks did, but when it was

           11     pointed out to you that it didn't, you amended that, right?

           12     Do you remember that?

           13     A.  No, but --

           14     Q.  Okay.  Well, are there any other studies that you say

           15     this shows that when you turn the Bair Hugger on, it

           16     increases particles over the surgical site?

           17     A.  No, I think those are it.

           18     Q.  Okay.  So these studies have a total of four patients --

           19     A.  Four mannequins.

           20     Q.  -- charitably because at least three of them are

           21     mannequins.

           22     A.  That's right.

           23     Q.  The particle sizes where they actually quantified them

           24     are all under 1 micron, except for the Legg 1 where they

           25     showed the mean number of 5 micron particles went up 2.8?



                                        
                                                             
                                                                             751


            1     A.  And the 4 millimeter bubbles.

            2     Q.  And do you think that 4 millimeter bubbles are a valid

            3     way of concluding that particles -- small particles would be

            4     mobilized over the surgical site?

            5     A.  Well, I think it's more reflective of bigger particles.

            6     Q.  Okay.  No quantification?  Just shows airflow patterns?

            7     A.  Correct.

            8     Q.  Okay.  Now, the next step in your analysis is to equate

            9     particles with bugs, right?

           10     A.  Correct.

           11     Q.  And for that you have chosen out of the literature the

           12     Stocks paper, right?

           13     A.  The which?

           14     Q.  Stocks.

           15     A.  Correct.

           16     Q.  Which you can find at -- same notebook.  It's P-27.

           17               That's your basis for the conclusion that if it

           18     increases particles, it's increasing bacteria, right?

           19     A.  Well, I don't know that I would make all particles

           20     equals bug.  Certainly some of the particles are carrying

           21     bugs.

           22     Q.  Okay.

           23     A.  Dr. Wenzel says 40 percent.

           24     Q.  The jury will hear what Dr. Wenzel actually has to say.

           25     But you think that's what he said, I encourage the jury to



                                        
                                                             
                                                                             752


            1     listen carefully.

            2               So Stocks is the only one you rely on, right?

            3     A.  No.  Seal's.

            4     Q.  Well, you didn't tell the jury yesterday about Seal and

            5     Clark.  But you want to throw that one in now?

            6     A.  Sure.

            7     Q.  Okay.  What was the particle -- the conclusion of Stocks

            8     is that the correlation that they demonstrated only applied

            9     to particles size 10 microns or greater, right?

           10     A.  Well, they don't word it exactly the way you just did.

           11     They said we found that the number airborne particles equal

           12     to a greater than 10 micron was correlated with the number

           13     of CFUs grown from air sampled within the sterile field

           14     approximately 40 centimeters from the surgical incision.  So

           15     they don't really comment --

           16     Q.  Okay.  By the way -- why don't you read the next

           17     sentence.

           18     A.  The number of 10 micron particles associated with the

           19     number of staff members present in the operating room during

           20     surgery.

           21     Q.  In other words, more staff, more 10 micron or greater

           22     particles?

           23     A.  Correct.

           24     Q.  That's not an unusual conclusion, right?

           25     A.  Well, I don't know what you mean by that.  There are



                                        
                                                             
                                                                             753


            1     relatively few studies, as you say, that have quantitated

            2     the different sizes.

            3     Q.  No, but in terms of what has the greatest impact of the

            4     particulate counts, it's the movement of staff?

            5     A.  The 10 micron particles are important, yes.

            6     Q.  Okay.  So if we look back at your reliance list -- by

            7     the way, do you remember how many patients there were?  I'm

            8     not exactly sure why that's an important metric, but I'm

            9     going to go with it.

           10     A.  Twenty-two patients.

           11     Q.  Okay.  And they were 10 micron particles.  By the way,

           12     what was the correlation?  Was it a 1:1 correlation?

           13     A.  Well, actually, I think one of the good things about

           14     this study is they looked at a wide variety of groups of

           15     particle sizes.  So they looked at 0.3 to 0.49, 0.5 to 0.99,

           16     1 to 2.9, 3 to 4.9, 5 to 9.99 and greater than 10.  So one,

           17     two, three, four, five, six different particle sizes.

           18     Q.  And the only one they said they correlated with the

           19     number of bacteria were the bigger ones, the 10 and

           20     greater -- 10 micron and greater ones, right?

           21     A.  Well, Table 2, statistical tests of the bivariate

           22     association between each potential predictor variable and

           23     the square root of the CFUs per cubic millimeter --

           24     actually, the 10 micron -- greater or equal to 10 microns is

           25     less than 0.001, so 1 in 1,000.  The 5 to 9.99 is 0.015.



                                        
                                                             
                                                                             754


            1     That's statistically significant.  And the 3 to 4.9 is 0.56,

            2     which is pretty close to being statistically significant.

            3     Q.  So are you saying you disagree with what the authors of

            4     the Stocks paper concluded?

            5     A.  No.  I'm just saying that if you look at the data, they

            6     have three particle size groups that are statistically

            7     significant or close to it.

            8     Q.  Have you ever heard the expression if you torture the

            9     data long enough, they will confess to anything?

           10     A.  I thought you wanted to do truth.  That's a fact.  Look

           11     at the table.  It is a fact.  It is right there.  I am not

           12     saying something that the authors did not say.  They put in

           13     Table 2.

           14     Q.  Well, the authors, do they anywhere conclude that

           15     anything smaller than 10 microns correlated with CFUs?

           16     A.  Yes, in Table 2.  The statistical test of the bivariate

           17     association, that is we are looking at the association.  Is

           18     it significant or is it not?  Three particle sized groups,

           19     two of them reached statistical significance and one is

           20     almost, at 0.05 would be statistically significant, and it's

           21     0.056.

           22     Q.  The whole purpose of this study was to determine if you

           23     could correlate particles with bacteria, right?

           24     A.  And those three sizes correlate.

           25     Q.  Well, that's what you say, but the authors don't say



                                        
                                                             
                                                                             755


            1     that in their text, do they?

            2     A.  No.  The authors focus on the 10 micron particles.  That

            3     doesn't mean that the others are totally irrelevant.

            4     Q.  So you're taking their data and drawing a conclusion

            5     that they don't draw?

            6     A.  How could you say that?  I just read you the results

            7     from Table 2.  Is that statistically significant or not?  I

            8     did not write Table 2.  Stocks and colleagues wrote it.  I'm

            9     just reading it to you.

           10     Q.  Stocks and colleagues also wrote the text explaining

           11     what their study found.  Where do they say that something

           12     under 10 microns correlated with particles?

           13     A.  Well, let me look at their discussion.  They focus their

           14     discussion on the 10 microns, 10 or greater.

           15     Q.  When you say they "focus" it, that's all they say,

           16     right?  They don't say anything in their conclusions despite

           17     how you're interpreting their data?

           18     A.  I'm not interpreting their data.  I'm reading you the

           19     fact.  You said you wanted truth.

           20     Q.  Okay.

           21     A.  Look at the table.  I did not write this paper.  I did

           22     not put these P values in here.  It says 5 to 9.99 microns,

           23     0.015.  That is statistically significant; is it not?

           24     Because they don't address it in the discussion, you're

           25     going it throw it out as irrelevant.  It's statistically



                                        
                                                             
                                                                             756


            1     significant.  It correlates.  We're looking at particles

            2     that correlate with bacteria, and this study shows two

            3     definitely correlate and a third is very close.

            4     Q.  Is this part of the CDC gold standard, to take a study

            5     and re-examine the raw data and come to a conclusion that's

            6     different from what the authors of the study came to after

            7     having conducted it?

            8     A.  Well, that is a false and misleading statement.  I am

            9     reading you the table.  Do you want to come up here and you

           10     can stand here?  We can show it to the jury.  You can show

           11     it to the Judge.  It's right here.  I'm reading it.  I'm not

           12     misinterpreting anything.  I'm not looking at raw data and

           13     making anything up.  I'm reading the table as it sits right

           14     here right now.

           15     Q.  So did Stocks at all misinterpret their own data when

           16     they said we found that the number of airborne particles

           17     equal to or greater than 10 microns were correlated with the

           18     number of CFU grown from air sampled within the sterile

           19     field approximately 40 centimeters from the surgical

           20     incision?

           21     A.  No.  That is true.  They just have not addressed the

           22     other two sizes and you'd have to ask them why.  I don't

           23     know why they didn't address it, but it is a finding.  It's

           24     not my finding.  It's not my interpretation of their

           25     finding.  It's not my re-analyzing their data and coming up



                                        
                                                             
                                                                             757


            1     with a finding.  It's me reading to you something you

            2     apparently don't want to see.

            3     Q.  Okay.  Why don't you turn to D-330.

            4     A.  P or D?

            5     Q.  D as in dog.

            6     A.  D-230?

            7     Q.  Yep -- no, 330.  I'm sorry.

            8     A.  330.  Okay.

            9     Q.  This is a study, "Microorganisms in Confined Habitats:

           10     Microbial Monitoring and Control of Intensive Care Units,

           11     Operating Rooms, Cleanrooms, and the International Space

           12     Station" by Mora, et al from 2016.

           13     A.  Correct.

           14     Q.  You have seen this before, right?

           15     A.  Yes.  It's a review paper.

           16     Q.  In fact, I showed it to you, right, in your deposition?

           17     A.  Could be.

           18     Q.  Do you recall coming across it in your search?

           19     A.  I remember looking at it.  I don't remember when and

           20     where.

           21     Q.  Well, take a look at page 6.  Very bottom paragraph on

           22     the left-hand side starting, "Many studies."  Okay?  Could

           23     you read that, please.

           24     A.  "Many studies have argued that the results of the

           25     particle count method do not correlate with the bacterial



                                        
                                                             
                                                                             758


            1     count results" and talks about three studies, all three of

            2     which look at either one or two particle sizes.

            3               "Only two studies" -- do you want me to go on?

            4     Q.  Yeah, please.

            5     A.  "Only two studies have shown that there is a correlation

            6     between the number of airborne particles and the number of

            7     CFUs.  The presence of particles >5 micron size indicate

            8     microbiological contamination in the aerosol."  Greater than

            9     5, not greater than 10.  Greater than 5.

           10     Q.  What do they cite for that?

           11     A.  What do they do?

           12     Q.  What do they cite for that?

           13     A.  Seal and Croft (sic) and Stocks.

           14     Q.  So let's go back to our chart of your particle reliance

           15     ones.  Both the Legg 2 and the Sessler ones, whatever the

           16     increase, it's clearly not in the particle range that even

           17     the minority view says correlates with bacteria, right?

           18     A.  Repeat that.

           19     Q.  Okay.  Just in the interest of time, this review paper

           20     that said, "Many studies have argued" and they cite that the

           21     particles don't correlate with bacteria (Landrin, Scaltriti,

           22     and Cristina), but only two have shown that there is a

           23     correlation and then only in greater than 5 microns (Seal

           24     and Clark and Stocks).  And we went through all of them,

           25     right?  You remember that?  You had the ones that show no



                                        
                                                             
                                                                             759


            1     correlation as part of the materials you reviewed?

            2     A.  Correct.

            3     Q.  But you chose not to say anything about them in your

            4     report, and you chose not to say anything about them to the

            5     jury, right?

            6     A.  We can talk about them if you'd like.  They looked at

            7     gross particle counts, so they are mixing the smaller and

            8     the larger particles together.

            9               The ones that found a significant correlation --

           10     the Seal and Clark and Stocks -- actually, they look -- Seal

           11     and Clark actually look at eight different particle count

           12     size, Stocks six different particle count size.  These

           13     others look at one or two or maximum three particle size.

           14     So they are lumping the small in with the bigger.  So you

           15     are getting the particles that probably don't represent much

           16     in with those that do.

           17     Q.  Dr. Jarvis, is there any study that correlates submicron

           18     particles with bacteria?

           19     A.  Submicron particles?

           20     Q.  Yeah, less than a micron.  Any study that you're aware

           21     of?

           22     A.  I'd have to go back and look at Seal and Clark.

           23     Certainly Stocks is -- what number was Stocks?  Do you

           24     remember what number Stocks was?

           25     Q.  P-27.



                                        
                                                             
                                                                             760


            1     A.  So less than a micron, no.

            2     Q.  Yeah.  One micron or less.

            3     A.  Correct.

            4     Q.  Any study at all that has said we've studied this and

            5     when you have particles the size of a micron or less, where

            6     there is smoke there is fire, you're going to find bacteria?

            7     A.  No.  I just said no.

            8     Q.  Okay.

            9     A.  And that's why you want to have these different particle

           10     sizes, so you don't dump all of those probably not important

           11     small -- very small particles in with the bigger ones and

           12     confuse everything.

           13     Q.  You said yesterday particles matter, right?

           14     A.  Absolutely.

           15     Q.  To do a riff on that, particle size matters, too, right?

           16     A.  Correct.

           17     Q.  Tiny particles are themselves not big enough to be

           18     bacteria, right?

           19     A.  Probably.  Yes.

           20     Q.  And bacteria, particularly staph epidermidis, don't

           21     float around by themselves as a single bacterium and land on

           22     people, right?

           23     A.  Well, they probably can, but I don't know that anybody

           24     has really done studies to look at that.  But I would agree

           25     that very small particles are probably irrelevant.  And



                                        
                                                             
                                                                             761


            1     that's why I think the Seals and Clark and the Stocks

            2     studies are better studies, because they break all those out

            3     and you can look at the larger particles and not be confused

            4     by the little particles.

            5     Q.  Where is the study that shows the Bair Hugger has any

            6     impact on larger particles?

            7     A.  Well, I don't know that there's a specific study that's

            8     looked at that at all.  The CFD models perhaps.

            9     Q.  So the whole basis of your causation opinion is that

           10     there are these studies that found that the Bair Hugger

           11     increases tiny particles over the surgical site and --

           12     A.  Tiny particles or increases particles?

           13     Q.  Yeah, tiny particles.

           14     A.  Well, how are you defining "tiny"?  Is 10 microns tiny?

           15     Q.  Show me the study that found Bair Hugger increased 10

           16     micron particles.

           17     A.  I don't know that any studies looked specifically at

           18     that, other than looking at particulates over the operative

           19     fields such as Stocks is doing here.

           20     Q.  Let's take a look at the Legg 1.  It actually looked at

           21     three different sizes, right?

           22     A.  Right, 0.3, 0.5, and 5.

           23     Q.  Really tiny, almost indescribably tiny, tiny, and very,

           24     very small?  0.3, 0.5, and 5?

           25     A.  But it didn't look at 10.



                                        
                                                             
                                                                             762


            1     Q.  Right.  But in terms of the number of particles in each

            2     of those categories, it plummets logarithmically when you go

            3     from 0.3 to 0.5 to 5, right?

            4     A.  Well, it does decrease.  But if that 2.8 lands on your

            5     prosthetic joint, that's important.  It doesn't take 10 of

            6     the 4.

            7     Q.  So is it your testimony that you're taking these studies

            8     that didn't find any -- didn't look or at least didn't

            9     report an increase in 10 micron particles as a result of the

           10     Bair Hugger and you're just saying, well, that's okay, they

           11     must have -- that must mean that 10 micron size particles

           12     increase too; and, hey, there are these studies that say if

           13     you have 10 micron particles or greater, there is a positive

           14     correlation with bacteria; well, therefore, the Bair Hugger

           15     increases bacteria?

           16     A.  Well, there was a lot of questions in that one.  You

           17     want to reword that?

           18     Q.  You don't have a single study that demonstrates by any

           19     methodology that the Bair Hugger increases particles over

           20     the surgical site -- particles over the surgical site of

           21     greater than 10 microns, right?

           22     A.  Greater than 10 microns --

           23     Q.  Equal to or greater than.

           24     A.  Well, the Stocks study looks at greater or equal to 10

           25     microns.

            1     Q.  That's right.  You keep wanting to tell us that the

            2     Stocks study is about the Bair Hugger.  It's not, right?

            3               MS. CONLIN:  I would object as argumentative, Your

            4     Honor.

            5               MR. COREY GORDON:  I withdraw.

            6               THE COURT:  Can you rephrase.

            7               MR. COREY GORDON:  Yes.  Apologize, Your Honor.

            8     BY MR. COREY GORDON:

            9     Q.  The Stocks study does not have anything to do with the

           10     Bair Hugger, doesn't it, Dr. Jarvis?

           11     A.  Correct.

           12     Q.  Is there any study -- there is no study that shows that

           13     the Bair Hugger increases particles of 10 microns or greater

           14     over the surgical site, right?

           15     A.  Well, there's none that look specifically at that issue.

           16     We have different pieces of the puzzle that are looked at in

           17     various studies.

           18     Q.  Okay.  And so you take those studies that show maybe

           19     small particles -- you say, well, that's a piece of the

           20     puzzle, must be moving bigger particles, too?  That's one of

           21     your leaps, right?

           22     A.  Well, and that's where Dr. Elghobashi in his model can

           23     help fill in that gap, where studies haven't been done.

           24     Q.  Okay.  And then you take like the Stocks study, and even

           25     though the authors were specifically looking for particle



                                        
                                                             
                                                                             764


            1     bacteria correlations and only concluded from their data

            2     that 10 microns or greater correlated, you've concluded that

            3     no, actually, there is a correlation with 5 micron and up?

            4     A.  Well, are you telling me that in Table 2 where it says

            5     the variable is 5 to 9.99 and the P value is 0.015 that I

            6     should ignore that, that it's irrelevant, that they report

            7     it and we don't want to look at some of the data?

            8     Q.  You know, this whole thing about particle and bacteria

            9     might be kind of confusing.  Why would anybody in an

           10     operating room care about counting particles and seeing if

           11     they measure up with bacteria?  Do you know?

           12     A.  Well, I think there are probably several reasons why

           13     they would want to do that.  One, which many of these

           14     authors have pointed out in their introductions and the

           15     discussion, is it would be very valuable during an

           16     orthopedic implant procedure to be able to do a test during

           17     the procedure that could be predictive of increased risks of

           18     infection --

           19     Q.  A real-time measurement?

           20     A.  -- or trying to prevent that from happening.

           21     Q.  That's because with the technology that's readily

           22     available to hospitals, not expensive military equipment,

           23     there is nothing that you can take into an operating room

           24     and push a button and look at a read-out and say we've got X

           25     number of bacteria, right?



                                        
                                                             
                                                                             765


            1     A.  Right.  Turn that machine off or let's not do surgery

            2     today, yeah.

            3     Q.  But they're hand-held units, you go in and push a button

            4     and it tells you the number of particles, right?

            5     A.  Correct.

            6     Q.  Doesn't tell you anything about whether the particles

            7     you're counting are completely inert, maybe a little

            8     bacteria or a lot of bacteria?  Tells nothing about

            9     bacteria, right?

           10     A.  Well, that's not true.  Stocks right here does.

           11     Q.  But that's why Stocks and all these other researchers

           12     have been trying to correlate that, because if they could

           13     correlate, then OR personnel could be confident that if they

           14     take a particle measurement and whatever they decide is

           15     relevant, things are okay or say we better stop and see

           16     what's going on?

           17     A.  Absolutely, why we shouldn't ignore it.

           18     Q.  But at least three researchers in papers that you read

           19     published in peer-reviewed journals concluded that you just

           20     can't correlate particles?

           21     A.  And, as I said, those three papers if you look carefully

           22     at them use different methodologies, and they don't do six

           23     or seven or eight or ten particle sizes.  They do one or two

           24     or at most three.  And, as a result, they are loading all

           25     the small particles in with the bigger particles and,



                                        
                                                             
                                                                             766


            1     therefore, finding no correlation between the two.  And I

            2     think the Stocks study and the Seal and Clark study are much

            3     better studies.

            4     Q.  So you, Dr. Jarvis, looked at these studies and you saw,

            5     well, these three, putting them aside?

            6     A.  I'm not putting them aside.  I'm saying the methodology

            7     is different and, therefore, you need to look more carefully

            8     at the study.

            9     Q.  You didn't even mention them in your report, right?

           10     A.  No, because I was mentioning the things that I was

           11     actually depending upon and showing were of value.

           12     Q.  And those three studies, they're of no value to

           13     supporting the opinion that the Bair Hugger causes surgical

           14     site infections, right?

           15     A.  If this study by Stocks had done nothing but look at all

           16     particle sizes lumped into one, they more than likely would

           17     have not found any correlation with bacterial contamination.

           18     It's the breakdown to these smaller sizes categories that

           19     led them to be able to detect the difference.  So in those

           20     other three studies that you mentioned where they don't do

           21     that I suspect -- and even Cristina says it in her

           22     discussion, that if she had looked at smaller populations of

           23     sizes, rather than a large group together, she might have

           24     seen a correlation.

           25     Q.  I don't want the jury to be misled.  We can take the



                                        
                                                             
                                                                             767


            1     time to go through what you said.  She didn't say -- I just

            2     want to make sure, no misunderstanding, if she had looked at

            3     smaller particles she would have found a correlation?

            4     A.  She said that if she had looked at particle categories,

            5     like Stocks is doing.

            6     Q.  Then she might have found a correlation?

            7     A.  Correct.

            8     Q.  Because she only looked at under 0.5 and over 5?

            9     A.  Correct, two large categories.

           10     Q.  Right.  So that over 5 category that didn't show any

           11     correlation included 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and on?

           12     A.  Correct.

           13     Q.  Where Stocks broke it down --

           14     A.  And when you look at this, that means she's including

           15     ones that don't correlate and ones that do correlate.

           16     Q.  So in that greater -- that 5 -- greater than 5 micron

           17     category it included ones that didn't correlate?

           18     A.  Correct.  So if she had broken it down and looked at 5

           19     to 9.99 and greater than equal to 10, she might have found a

           20     correlation and she says that.

           21     Q.  She might have found the same correlation that Stocks

           22     reported, 10 microns and greater?

           23     A.  That's what I just said.

           24     Q.  Yeah.

           25     A.  But she didn't look.



                                        
                                                             
                                                                             768


            1     Q.  Okay.  All this stuff about particles and correlations

            2     and, you know, all that stuff, wouldn't it be a lot simpler

            3     to just measure bacteria in an operating room with a Bair

            4     Hugger on or off or comparing it to some other warming

            5     device like these studies that you rely on for particle

            6     counts?

            7     A.  Well, you certainly could do that study.  You could do a

            8     randomized control trial looking at SSIs, and certainly

            9     Sessler has recommended that to 3M.  I wish they'd done it.

           10     Q.  You could've done it, too, then, right?

           11     A.  I don't think I could've done it that easily.

           12     Q.  Okay.

           13     A.  3M certainly has the funding.  They could do it.

           14     Q.  But on the issue of actually looking at the Bair

           15     Hugger's impact on bacteria, there aren't studies, right?

           16     A.  What do you mean by "impact on bacteria"?

           17     Q.  Actually measuring bacteria, not some surrogate, like

           18     particles, and then trying to argue, well, where there is

           19     smoke there must be fire.  Measuring the fire.

           20     A.  Well, there certainly have been microbiologic studies

           21     of --

           22     Q.  And you cannot -- well, strike that.

           23               Can you point to one that found that the Bair

           24     Hugger had a statistically significant impact on the number

           25     of bacteria arriving at the surgical site?



                                        
                                                             
                                                                             769


            1     A.  I don't believe that study has been done.

            2     Q.  But several studies have been done and looked for that,

            3     right?

            4     A.  Which ones are you thinking of?  I think there's -- I

            5     think I can think of one study where they took two, two

            6     devices, and did that.  Very, very small number, smaller

            7     than we have on the mannequins on this.

            8     Q.  The study was smaller?  Are you talking about Oguz?  You

            9     hadn't mentioned Oguz yesterday.

           10     A.  No.  I'm not -- no.  That's not the one I'm thinking of.

           11     Q.  Okay.  Well, let's talk about Oguz.

           12     A.  Okay.  Sure.

           13     Q.  P-635.

           14     A.  Okay.

           15     Q.  Oguz was a comparison study, right, between the Bair

           16     Hugger and a different device, the same exact device, Legg

           17     1, Legg 2, and McGovern, right?

           18     A.  It's a comparison of forced air with an electric

           19     blanket.

           20     Q.  It's the same electric blanket in all those studies,

           21     right?

           22     A.  Could be.  I'd have to go back and look.

           23     Q.  And on first page of Oguz they say, "The aim of the

           24     study was thus to determine the influence of four

           25     intraoperative factors -- use of laminar airflow, duration



                                        
                                                             
                                                                             770


            1     of surgery, number of health professionals present, and use

            2     of forced air -- on airborne bacterial contamination,

            3     measured by 6 sedimentation plates at standardized locations

            4     in the OR including two locations on the instrument table."

            5     "Sedimentation plates," that's the agar plate that we've

            6     talked about, right?

            7     A.  Right.  So there is really no agar plate on the patient.

            8     The closest one is plate 4.

            9     Q.  Okay.  And they randomized the patients during these

           10     minor orthopedic surgeries, right?

           11     A.  Correct.

           12     Q.  And the mean duration of surgery was right around an

           13     hour, right?

           14     A.  Right.  So half the length of Mr. Gareis' surgery.

           15     Q.  But that Dr. Elghobashi thing, that shows that the

           16     particles start moving over the mannequin and the, whatever,

           17     about less than a minute, right?

           18     A.  Right.

           19     Q.  So if that's right, well, then in 60 minutes certainly

           20     you would expect to see an increase in bacteria if the Bair

           21     Hugger is blowing all this bacteria over into the surgical

           22     site?

           23     A.  Possibly.

           24     Q.  So these authors randomized patients -- real patients

           25     undergoing real surgery with real personnel, real equipment,



                                        
                                                             
                                                                             771


            1     real movement of staff, real door openings and closings, all

            2     of these things -- same comparison, head-to-head comparison,

            3     as the particle studies you rely on, and they found no

            4     statistically significant difference for the Bair Hugger and

            5     the other device in terms of particle -- or, excuse me,

            6     bacteria counts?

            7     A.  Well, if you look at plate 4 -- and this is their

            8     multi-variant analysis -- the 95 percent -- 0.92 to 2.6 g1.

            9               Is very close to being statistically significant.

           10     Q.  Take a look at page 2, 002, under Discussion, fifth

           11     paragraph down.  Could you read that, please.

           12     A.  "An important finding of our study was that the type of

           13     patient warming did not influence the amount of bacterial

           14     sedimentation on either plate position.  It is important to

           15     remember, that the introduction of an efficient forced air

           16     patient-warming system initially led to a major decrease in

           17     wound infections, which had a higher incidence of unwarmed

           18     patients with accidental perioperative hypothermia."

           19     Q.  Why don't you keep reading the full paragraph.

           20     A.  "Evidence for the many beneficial effects of

           21     perioperative normothermia is undeniably fully established."

           22     Disagree with that.  "However, over the last years there has

           23     been a lively discussion if the air from forced air warming

           24     devices might directly distribute bacteria originating from

           25     the environment or the inside of the device into the sterile



                                        
                                                             
                                                                             772


            1     field in clinically relevant amounts, as micro-organisms

            2     have been detected in such warming devices and in the air

            3     coming from those devices."

            4     Q.  So they actually tested for bacteria during real

            5     orthopedic surgeries, right?

            6     A.  Right, minor orthopedic surgeries with only one implant.

            7     Q.  And an important finding of this study was that it

            8     didn't matter, the Bair Hugger did not increase the bacteria

            9     over a non-forced air device?

           10     A.  Well, realizing that they did agar plates and most of

           11     the agar plates are put distant from the patient with plate

           12     4 being the only one that's really somewhat close to the

           13     patient -- not that close, but somewhat close -- and it's

           14     almost statistically significant.

           15     Q.  Okay.  So that's not a study you want to include in your

           16     --

           17     A.  It's not a matter of liking or not liking a paper.  I'm

           18     just pointing out what the -- all papers have strengths and

           19     weaknesses, and this one has some as well.

           20               THE COURT:  All right.  We're going to break for

           21     just a short lunch break, so half an hour.

           22               THE LAW CLERK:  All rise.

            5               And Mr. Gordon, you may proceed.

            6               MR. COREY GORDON:  Thank you, Your Honor.

            7     BY MR. COREY GORDON:

            8     Q.  Dr. Jarvis, you said the study to find bacteria hadn't

            9     been done.  I would like to go back to some of the studies

           10     you talked about yesterday.  Start with P1, Zink.  You

           11     recall this, this study, right?

           12     A.  The Zink study?

           13     Q.  Yeah.

           14     A.  Yes.

           15     Q.  You didn't like it because it had volunteers and there

           16     were only eight of them, right?

           17     A.  Well, it wasn't a matter of liking or not liking, I was

           18     just talking about the strengths and weaknesses.

           19     Q.  Okay.  But that's all you talked about, though, was

           20     those weaknesses?

           21     A.  What's that?

           22     Q.  That's all you talked about was those weaknesses, eight

           23     people and it was volunteers and it wasn't a real surgery,

           24     but you didn't talk about what it concluded, did you?

           25     A.  I don't recall.



                                   
                                        

                                                                             774


            1     Q.  Okay.  Well, this was a study where they placed agar

            2     plates right on the abdomen through sterile drapes of

            3     volunteers and had the Bair Hugger on for two hours or off.

            4     If you look at the front page there, no significant

            5     difference in the number of bacterial colonies were observed

            6     between the two study periods.  Did I read that correctly?

            7     A.  Yes.

            8     Q.  Let's turn to P215.  That's the Wang study?

            9     A.  What was that number again?

           10     Q.  P215.  This is -- was a study that actually took place

           11     during real surgery.  They collected bacterial content both

           12     in the air and from the wound specimens during -- collected

           13     during surgery, right?

           14     A.  Right, during vascular surgery, right.

           15     Q.  Right.  And the result showed not only that there was no

           16     increase in bacterial counts at the study site but also

           17     there was a decrease in air bacterial content around the

           18     patient and in the operating theater after prolonged use of

           19     the patient warmer.  Did I read that correctly?

           20     A.  Based on just number of colonies.

           21     Q.  All right.  Colonies of bacteria, right?

           22     A.  Right.

           23     Q.  Not particles, colonies?

           24     A.  Right.

           25     Q.  Let me direct you to 727.  You talked about that a



                                   
                                        

                                                                             775


            1     little yesterday.  It's the Moretti study.  And I believe

            2     your this morning was you told the jury this study showed

            3     that when the Bair Hugger was either turned on, it

            4     significantly raised the bacteria over the at rest

            5     conditions, right?

            6     A.  That's what they said, yes.

            7     Q.  In fact, you read a portion of it where it talked about

            8     it there being a significant increase in mean bacterial load

            9     compared with at rest conditions, right?

           10     A.  That's what they said.

           11     Q.  Yeah, but you didn't actually tell the jury about the

           12     intermediate step to which the Bair Hugger was compared,

           13     right?  The at rest was nobody, nothing in the room except

           14     the measuring devices, right?

           15     A.  Right.

           16     Q.  Then they brought in people, brought in the staff, the

           17     patients, et cetera.  They took measurements then.  Then

           18     they turned on the Bair Hugger.  And you left out that

           19     intermediate step, right?

           20     A.  I didn't leave it out.  I read the first part of the

           21     results.

           22     Q.  Okay.  Brett, could I have Figure 2 up on the board, on

           23     the whatever it is.

           24               So, Doctor, I am-- well, that's Figure 2 from the

           25     Moretti study, right?



                                   
                                        

                                                                             776


            1     A.  That's right.

            2     Q.  And these are the measurements of colony forming units

            3     at the various locations throughout the operating room, and

            4     there is nothing in there that's at rest, right?

            5     A.  I don't know if there's nothing in there, but --

            6     Q.  Well, there are no people in there?

            7     A.  Right.

            8     Q.  This is the measurements when the Bair Hugger's on,

            9     right?

           10     A.  Correct.

           11     Q.  And you said, and you pointed out that there's a

           12     statistically significant increase from this point to this

           13     point, right?

           14     A.  Right.  Which the authors describe.

           15     Q.  Yeah, but actually there's a much bigger increase when

           16     people come in the room and starting getting things ready,

           17     right?

           18     A.  Right.

           19     Q.  And when the Bair Hugger is on, it goes down, right?

           20     A.  Down some, not to rest, but yeah.

           21     Q.  Take it off.

           22               If you turn to page 771, that's the Hall paper

           23     that you read?

           24     A.  It's not really a paper.  It's not published.  It's a

           25     poster.



                                   
                                        

                                                                             777


            1     Q.  Doctor, do you have any posters that show the Bair

            2     Hugger increase in bacteria over the surgical site?

            3     A.  No.

            4     Q.  Okay.

            5     A.  I'm just pointing out that it does not appear to be a

            6     publication.  And this was done in 1991, so if the authors

            7     thought it was really important, I would have thought in the

            8     ensuing, what, 20 years they would have taken the time to

            9     publish it.

           10     Q.  Okay.  Again, this was microbial culture plates exposed

           11     in an actual OR during real cases and then a microbiologist

           12     examined the contamination?

           13     A.  Right, in 20 oral and maxillofacial surgery procedures.

           14     Q.  Yeah.  Well, how many surgeries, actual surgeries, do

           15     you have that show anything about the Bair Hugger?

           16     A.  One.

           17     Q.  What's that, McGovern?

           18     A.  Yeah.

           19     Q.  Yeah, okay.  We will talk about that.

           20     A.  Those are prosthetic joint procedures, which is

           21     relevant.

           22     Q.  All right.  In Hall they say there was no detectible

           23     differences in contamination rates between the groups, with

           24     or without Bair Hugger.  7.33 colonies with no Bair Hugger,

           25     7.27 with Bair Hugger.  Absolute raw numbers, they went down



                                   
                                        

                                                                             778


            1     with the Bair Hugger turned on?

            2     A.  It's interesting all thee of these studies basically put

            3     the ager plates in the same place.  Except the one that was

            4     on the abdomen, they were around the outside of the room and

            5     then one somewhat proximate to the patient but not really

            6     near the surgical site.

            7     Q.  Well, Doctor, wouldn't you agree that when you are doing

            8     surgery, you probably don't want to have agar plates right

            9     in the way?

           10     A.  Well, I don't know.  Darush put the particle counter

           11     right next to the surgical incision in HEPA filtered air.

           12     Q.  Let's talk about McGovern.

           13     A.  And it is interesting, if you look at --

           14     Q.  There's no question pending now.

           15     A.  Don't want to look at the data?  Okay.

           16     Q.  If you turn to P93.

           17     A.  93?

           18     Q.  P93.  It's McGovern.  You already talked a little bit

           19     about this with the bubble part of it.  There was another

           20     part of it.  After they did the bubble study, they took a

           21     look at infection rates before and after and made some

           22     changes at the hospital, right?

           23     A.  Right.

           24     Q.  Okay.  This would be what's called an time -- an

           25     interrupted time series observational study?



                                   
                                        

                                                                             779


            1     A.  Definitely an observational study, yeah.

            2     Q.  And one of the big problems with interrupted time series

            3     is if you look at one period in time and another period in

            4     time and try to just isolate out one thing when there's been

            5     all sorts of changes on both sides, you can't really ascribe

            6     any correlation or causation to any change in one number,

            7     right?

            8     A.  I don't think I would agree with that characterization.

            9     Obviously a confounding variable is only important if it's a

           10     confounding variable.  If it has nothing to do with the

           11     price of tea in China, then obviously it doesn't matter if

           12     it changed.  It has to be related to the event you are

           13     looking for and, in this case, prosthetic joint infections.

           14     Q.  In this case, the authors on page 0007 said this study

           15     does not establish a causal basis for this association,

           16     right?

           17     A.  Correct.

           18     Q.  Let's go on, though.  They say, Although the

           19     demographics were similar between the patient groups in

           20     items of risk factors for infections, the data are

           21     observational and may be confounded by other infection

           22     control measures instituted by the hospital.  For example,

           23     changes were made to the antibiotic, thromboprophylaxis

           24     protocols used during the study, although no infection

           25     control changes were made after February 2010.



                                   
                                        

                                                                             780


            1               In addition, we were unable to consider all

            2     factors that have been associated with SSI, as the details

            3     of blood transfusion, obesity, incontinence, and fitness for

            4     surgery which have been identified elsewhere as important

            5     predictors for deep infection were not sufficiently dealed

            6     in the medical record.  Did I read that correctly?

            7     A.  Correct.

            8     Q.  So that's really saying two things.  They were changing

            9     other infection control practices during this time period,

           10     right?

           11     A.  Well, they said there were none after February 2010, so

           12     not during the whole time period, no.

           13     Q.  Okay.  And if you want to take the time, we can go

           14     through it, but the Bair Hugger, the time period of the Bair

           15     Hugger that they were looking at went from July 2008 to

           16     March of 2010, so there were lots of changes going on before

           17     the Bair Hugger -- during the Bair Hugger period?

           18     A.  Well --

           19     Q.  Stopped making changes --

           20     A.  -- you're characterizing it as a lot.  I don't know

           21     that's the case.  They haven't listed them.  They just say

           22     that there were none after February 2010.  They don't say we

           23     did four before 2010 or 10 or 20 or 1.

           24     Q.  Dr. Jarvis, you know that they changed the

           25     thromboprophylaxis back and forth, that's an anti-blood



                                   
                                        

                                                                             781


            1     clot, right?

            2     A.  Right.  And the thromboprophylaxis is given after

            3     surgery.

            4     Q.  And they had some problems with it with increased return

            5     to theater that they switched right back after only seven

            6     months?

            7     A.  And there have been studies showing no impact on

            8     prosthetic joint infections too.

            9     Q.  And there have been studies showing that it increases

           10     deep joint infections, aren't there?

           11     A.  Well, there were some randomized controlled trials

           12     showing the opposite too.

           13     Q.  But you just want to talk about the ones that support

           14     the position that you are advocating here, right?

           15     A.  No, I'm saying that they're both.

           16     Q.  Okay.

           17     A.  That the -- go ahead.

           18     Q.  If you look at figure -- or Table 2, excuse me, the only

           19     comparison they did in terms of possible infection control

           20     changes, even though they mentioned some as examples, is

           21     they did a univariant analysis between the Bair Hugger and

           22     when they switched over to a different warming device,

           23     right?

           24     A.  Correct.

           25     Q.  They didn't do a multi varied analysis like you and your



                                   
                                        

                                                                             782


            1     colleagues did after you did the uni varied analysis in that

            2     1990 study, right?

            3     A.  Correct.

            4     Q.  And there are a whole bunch of things that they didn't

            5     even look at, they couldn't look at, because they didn't

            6     have the data, and one of those was fitness for surgery,

            7     right?

            8     A.  How ever they evaluate that, yes.

            9     Q.  That's ASA, right?  They do not -- they don't call it

           10     that in England, but ASA is a measure of fitness for

           11     surgery, right?

           12     A.  Could be, yes.

           13     Q.  And after you went through all of your univariant

           14     analyses of all those factors that you carefully examined

           15     and carefully culled out of the records and interviews and

           16     examinations, you did the uni varied analyses of all those

           17     factors, you found I think you said ten that might have been

           18     contributors, then you did a uni -- a multi varied analysis

           19     and you found that fitness for surgery as measured by the

           20     ASA was significant difference in doctor X's client or

           21     patient group than --

           22     A.  Well, an ASA --

           23     Q.  The --

           24     A.  -- equal to or greater than three.

           25               THE COURT REPORTER:  Could you say that again?

            1               THE WITNESS:  An ASA equal to or greater than

            2     three.

            3     BY MR. COREY GORDON:

            4     Q.  And if you turn to P860, this is the CDC guideline for

            5     prevention of surgical site infection from 1999, right?

            6     A.  Correct.

            7     Q.  And you were the coordinator who pulled this together,

            8     right?

            9     A.  Correct.

           10     Q.  And you are listed as the senior author, right?

           11     A.  Correct.

           12     Q.  And this was your -- your colleagues and the CDC's

           13     attempt to give the best guidance to hospitals, physicians,

           14     and others involved in medical care for reducing surgical

           15     site infections, right?

           16     A.  Correct.

           17     Q.  And that includes periprosthetic deep joint infections,

           18     right?

           19     A.  It's not specific to that.

           20     Q.  No.

           21     A.  It's a general guideline, but it includes that.

           22     Q.  But it's not just about superficial infections, is it?

           23     A.  Oh no, absolutely not.

           24     Q.  Okay.  If you turn to page 0008.  I'm sorry, 0007.

           25     A.  Yes.



                                   
                                        

                                                                             784


            1     Q.  And the first full paragraph on the bottom of the

            2     right-hand column, you wrote, For most SSIs, the source of

            3     pathogens is the endogenous flora of the patient's skin,

            4     mucous membranes, or hollow viscera.  Did I read that right?

            5     A.  Correct.

            6     Q.  And you go on to say, When mucus membranes or skin is

            7     incised, the exposed tissues are at risk for contamination

            8     with endogenous flora.  Did I read that right?

            9     A.  Yes.

           10     Q.  And you mentioned it yesterday, endogenous means what we

           11     have on our bodies, in our bodies, it's our bacteria, right?

           12     A.  Correct.

           13     Q.  It's what the patient brings to the table?

           14     A.  Correct.

           15     Q.  Okay.  So in 1999, when you were working for the CDC and

           16     you reviewed all the literature and did that CDC gold

           17     standard and you were trying to give guidance to

           18     practitioners who were actually on the firing line, you told

           19     them that for most SSIs, the source of pathogens is the

           20     endogenous flora, what the patient brings to the table?

           21     A.  Right.  And that goes back to what we talked about

           22     earlier, that if you look at all SSIs, remember those three

           23     categories, two-thirds of SSIs are that top incisional

           24     layer.

           25     Q.  Yeah.



                                   
                                        

                                                                             785


            1     A.  So the endogenous flora is important for that, and that

            2     is why it is the most common is because the most common site

            3     of infection is not deep organ space or prosthetic joint, it

            4     is superficial incisional and that's where the patient's

            5     skin is important.

            6     Q.  And, Doctor, this has lots of references for each of the

            7     assertions in it, doesn't it?

            8     A.  Has lots of reference.

            9     Q.  References, scientific research, literature, articles at

           10     the back, footnotes?

           11     A.  Oh, absolutely, yeah.

           12     Q.  So for the statement that you make here when mucus

           13     membranes where skin is incised, the exposed tissues are at

           14     risk for contamination with endogenous flora, you list one

           15     reference, right?

           16     A.  Right.

           17     Q.  And that would be reference number 58, right?

           18     A.  Right.

           19     Q.  Could you go to the reference list and just read for the

           20     jury the title of that reference?

           21     A.  58?

           22     Q.  Yep.

           23     A.  Roots of infection, a study of using tracer particles in

           24     orthopedic operating room.  So it's looking at all SSIs, not

           25     just prosthetic joint infections.



                                   
                                        

                                                                             786


            1     Q.  Turn to the next page.  That's still part of that

            2     endogenous paragraph, right, person's own bacteria that you

            3     are discussing, right?

            4     A.  What do you mean it's a part of the paragraph?

            5     Q.  Well, we are going to talk about it, but the next

            6     paragraph is you start talking about exogenous sources, but

            7     the top of the column on page 0008 is still, it's a

            8     continuation of your paragraph on endogenous sources?

            9     A.  Correct.

           10     Q.  Okay.  And towards the bottom of that paragraph you say

           11     seating of the operative site from a distance focus of

           12     infection can be another source of SSI pathogens, right?

           13     A.  Correct.

           14     Q.  And you list several references there, right?

           15     A.  Three, yep.

           16     Q.  And one of them is reference number 60, right?

           17     A.  Yep.

           18     Q.  Could you please read to the jury the title of that

           19     article, reference 60?

           20     A.  Prophylactic antibiotics against early and late deep

           21     infections after total hip replacements.  And that's a study

           22     of the appropriate timing and delivery of prophylactic

           23     antibiotics.

           24     Q.  And that's one of the cites for your conclusion of

           25     seating in the operative site from a distance focus of



                                   
                                        

                                                                             787


            1     infection to be another source of endogenous pathogens that

            2     cause deep joint infections, right?

            3     A.  Right.  Urinary tract infection, yeah.

            4     Q.  And you -- the rest of that sentence is particularly in

            5     patients who have a prosthesis or other implant placed

            6     during the operation, right?

            7     A.  Correct.

            8     Q.  And you go on to say that such devices provide for

            9     attachment of the organs, right?

           10     A.  Correct.

           11     Q.  Now, you --

           12     A.  The other references are to prosthetic valve endocardia.

           13     Q.  Okay.  Now, let's -- so are you trying to suggest that

           14     these -- this doesn't refer to prosthetic implants and --

           15     A.  Oh, no.  No, I'm pointing out that it's broad, talking

           16     about a variety of implants.

           17     Q.  Okay.  And you said a whole -- there is several

           18     references for this, that statement, right?

           19     A.  Correct.

           20     Q.  Okay.  One of them is 69?

           21     A.  Correct.

           22     Q.  Could you read that, the title?

           23     A.  Total joint replacement a consideration for

           24     antimicrobial prophylaxis.

           25     Q.  That's a citation that you used for this statement that



                                   
                                        

                                                                             788


            1     seating of the operative site can be from remote sources and

            2     it's particularly in patients who have an implant?

            3     A.  And realized both of those references were on

            4     prophylactic antibiotics, so I think it's primarily

            5     addressing if a patient comes in and they have an infection

            6     outside of their joint, you shouldn't be doing the surgery,

            7     but if you do, you need to really make sure you give the

            8     appropriate prophylaxis.

            9     Q.  Another one you wrote -- another one of your references

           10     there is 71, right?

           11     A.  Right.

           12     Q.  Would you read that title to the jury, please?

           13     A.  Multiple irrigation, debridement, and retention of

           14     components and infected total knee arthroplasty.

           15     Q.  Do you have any problem with that study?

           16     A.  I don't know that I have a problem with any of the

           17     studies, but I would have to go look at it.  I haven't read

           18     that one in a while.

           19     Q.  Who is the first author on that one, by the way?

           20     A.  Doctor Mont.

           21     Q.  Okay.  And what is irrigation?  What does that refer to?

           22     A.  What is irrigation?

           23     Q.  Yeah.

           24     A.  Taking fluid and basically shooting it into the wound

           25     and then sucking it out.



                                   
                                        

                                                                             789


            1     Q.  Okay.  And that's frequently done at the end of joint

            2     surgeries to -- purposefully to clean out any bacteria that

            3     might have gotten in there?

            4     A.  Well, to try to dilute out bacteria as well as tissue,

            5     yes.

            6     Q.  And Dr. Presnal copiously irrigated Mr. Gareis' surgical

            7     site just before he closed it, right?

            8     A.  That's what he said.

            9     Q.  And the last cite I'm going to draw your attention to is

           10     73.  Could you just read that to the jury?

           11     A.  Etiology of deep sepsis in the total hip arthroplastic,

           12     the significance of hematogenous and recurrent infections.

           13     Q.  And you decided that after your reviewing the medical

           14     records, there couldn't possibly have been hematogenous

           15     seating of Mr. Gareis's joint?

           16     A.  Well, if you read any of those papers, they don't

           17     describe transient asymptotic bacteriemia.

           18     Q.  What is transient asymptomatic bacteriemia?

           19     A.  It's where organisms potentially get into the blood and

           20     then the immune system eradicates them.

           21     Q.  Happens to every one of us?

           22     A.  Theoretically, yes.

           23     Q.  Almost daily, right?

           24     A.  Theoretically.

           25     Q.  But if you have got a joint that's just been implanted,



                                   
                                        

                                                                             790


            1     before the tissue is formed, before the bone has -- or the,

            2     it's really fused to the bone, if it just happens to be the

            3     path that that handful of bacteria take in the bloodstream

            4     before the immune system can get them, then they could cause

            5     a deep joint infection, right?

            6     A.  Oh, I think that's a theoretical possibility.  I'm not

            7     sure that many would say that's more likely than not

            8     happening a lot.

            9     Q.  Okay.

           10     A.  Most of the, when they are talking about another site of

           11     infections on a hematogenous spread, it's with a UTI or

           12     pneumonia or MRSA skin infection.  It's a definitive

           13     infection where they have clinical signs and symptoms and

           14     document a positive blood culture.

           15     Q.  Doctor, now we're going to switch to my white book just

           16     very briefly.  One thing you said yesterday, in all of your

           17     exhaustive research you couldn't find a single study that

           18     showed any benefit of keeping a patient warm during

           19     orthopedic surgery, right?

           20     A.  Well, you are being a little broad and mischaracterizing

           21     what I said.  You said any surgery.

           22     Q.  Any orthopedic implant?

           23     A.  Implant surgery.  There are several that have shown an

           24     increase in estimated blood loss, but even in those, they

           25     have not tended to show an increase in the need for



                                   
                                        

                                                                             791


            1     transfusion.  So I really was looking at many of the things

            2     that you and your colleagues had talked about, myocardial

            3     infarction, death, surgical site infections which is really

            4     what's important to all of us, cardiac arrhythmias, and

            5     blood transfusion.

            6     Q.  If you turn to D0961.

            7     A.  Okay.

            8     Q.  It's a 1996 paper by Schmid, et al. that was published

            9     in the Lancette, right?

           10     A.  Correct.

           11     Q.  The Lancette's one of the very top medical journals in

           12     the world, right?

           13     A.  Well, the Lancette, it's a well recognized British

           14     journal, yes.

           15     Q.  And this was an randomized prospective controlled trial

           16     where 60 patients undergoing primary unilateral total hip

           17     arthroplasty?

           18     A.  Correct.

           19     Q.  That's exactly what Mr. Gareis had, right?

           20     A.  That's what?

           21     Q.  That's exactly what Mr. Gareis had, right?

           22     A.  Correct.

           23     Q.  Okay.  And they were assigned to be either kept at a

           24     core temperature of approximately 36.6 or what they -- what

           25     the study characterizes as mild hypothermia, 35.0, right?



                                   
                                        

                                                                             792


            1     A.  So similar to what you mentioned earlier.  So this is a

            2     group where actually both arms are exposed to the Bair

            3     Hugger.

            4     Q.  And the group that was purposely cooled down or kept at

            5     the 35 degrees, and that's Celsius, the conclusion was the

            6     maintenance of intraoperative normothermia reduces blood

            7     loss and allogeneic blood requirements in patients

            8     undergoing total hip arthroplasty, right?

            9     A.  Where is that?

           10     Q.  Under interpretation, the bottom of the first column.

           11     A.  So this is one where the estimated blood loss was

           12     greater in the hypothermic group than the normothermic

           13     group.

           14     Q.  Where do you see estimated blood loss?

           15     A.  On Table 2.  But the intraoperative blood transfusion

           16     was no -- not significantly different.  And the

           17     postoperative blood administration was not significantly

           18     different.

           19     Q.  Okay.  Doctor, I don't know what you are looking at

           20     but --

           21     A.  I'm looking at Table 2 which is the results of the

           22     study.

           23     Q.  Okay.  Well, the authors of the study say in the

           24     discussion right below Table 2, consistent with invitro

           25     data, that's laboratory studies, right?



                                   
                                        

                                                                             793


            1     A.  Correct.

            2     Q.  Our results indicate that mild hypothermia significantly

            3     increase bleeding, less than two degrees Celsius

            4     perioperative hypothermia increased blood loss about 500

            5     milliliters or one unit.  It also goes on to say in the next

            6     paragraph, or in the next page -- well, starts -- many more

            7     hypothermic patients required allogeneic transfusions and

            8     the overall volume transfused was significantly greater in

            9     the unwarmed patients.  Did I read that correctly?

           10     A.  I'm not sure where you are reading, so I can't say --

           11     Q.  I may have misspoken.  The many more hypothermic

           12     patients, starts at the very bottom of the left-hand column

           13     on 291?

           14     A.  291.

           15     Q.  Under your Table 2.

           16     A.  Okay.

           17     Q.  Many more hypothermic patients required allogeneic

           18     transfusions and the overall volume transfused was

           19     significantly greater in the unwarmed patients?

           20     A.  Yeah, I -- I haven't seen this paper in great depth

           21     before, so I would have to read it and really look at it.

           22     When they are looking at allogeneic blood, they are talking

           23     about one patient in the normothermic group and seven

           24     patients in the hypothermic group and doesn't reach

           25     statistical significant at.  06 so I --



                                   
                                        

                                                                             794


            1     Q.  So when they say it's significantly different,

            2     Dr. Jarvis said, nope, it isn't?

            3     A.  Well, it's not Dr. Jarvis saying that.  I'm reading you

            4     the results of the table.  You know, every time we go to a

            5     table and you don't like the results, you tell me that I'm

            6     making data up.

            7     Q.  I can --

            8     A.  We can end it around if you want.  I don't care.  I am

            9     just reading you what it says.  As I say, I haven't read

           10     this paper in great detail, but I am looking at Table 2.

           11     Q.  Apparently --

           12     A.  And I agree that Table 2 shows there's a significant

           13     difference in cumulative blood loss between the two groups.

           14     Q.  What's an allogeneic transfusion?

           15     A.  Drawing your own blood out and giving it back to you, so

           16     there's probably a lower threshold for giving that than

           17     giving a non-allogeneic blood transfusion.

           18     Q.  Well, the authors here say the administration of

           19     algogenic blood carries risk of infection.  Do you agree

           20     with that?

           21     A.  Well, certainly in the UK and the US, that risk is very,

           22     very low.  When was this paper published?  It might --

           23     Q.  1996.

           24     A.  Well, maybe they were a bit more concerned about HIV at

           25     that time but it's still blood was being screened at that



                                   
                                        

                                                                             795


            1     point, so I would say the risk is pretty low.

            2     Q.  So today you think that no big deal if you have

            3     increased blood loss because you're hypothermic during the

            4     arthroplasty?

            5               MS. CONLIN:  Objection.  Argumentative.

            6               MR. COREY GORDON:  I will withdraw it Your Honor.

            7     BY MR. COREY GORDON:

            8     Q.  If you could turn now to D0963?

            9     A.  Okay.

           10     Q.  What's the title of this study?

           11     A.  Aggressive warming reduces blood loss during hip

           12     arthroplasty.

           13     Q.  And in the abstract it says we randomly assigned 150

           14     patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty with spinal

           15     anesthesia to aggressive warming to maintain a tem panic

           16     membrane temperature of 36.5 degrees Celsius or conventional

           17     warming 36 degrees Celsius.  Did I read that correctly?

           18     A.  Yes.

           19     Q.  And total hip arthoplasty with spinal anesthesia, that's

           20     exactly what Mr. Gareis had, isn't it?

           21     A.  Yes.

           22     Q.  And the difference in the two groups was half a degree

           23     Celsius, right?

           24     A.  Correct.

           25     Q.  And the conclusions, summary, on the right paragraph of



                                   
                                        

                                                                             796


            1     the abstract intraoperative blood loss was significantly

            2     greater in the conventional warming, 618 milliliters

            3     interquartile range, 400, 864 milliliters than the

            4     aggressive warming group.  Skip the statistics.  Total blood

            5     loss during surgery and over the first two postoperative

            6     days was also significantly greater in the conventional

            7     warming group than in the aggressively warmed group.  Did I

            8     read that correctly?

            9     A.  Yes.

           10     Q.  So here's another actual study that shows during hip

           11     arthroplasty even a half a degree of heat core temperature

           12     heat loss results in blood loss and blood loss even

           13     continuing in the first two operative days, right?

           14     A.  Correct.

           15     Q.  The study was out of Vienna, it looks like.  Do you

           16     think that in 2000 in Vienna the conditions were somehow

           17     different than they are today in terms of how warming

           18     affects blood loss?

           19     A.  Would you repeat that?

           20     Q.  I will withdraw the question.  Briefly, have you

           21     reviewed that study before yesterday?

           22     A.  I had seen that.  I had mentioned earlier that I agreed

           23     it led to greater blood loss.  None of these have shown

           24     anything about surgical site infection, though.

           25     Q.  Well, I know you rest about surgical site infections but



                                   
                                        

                                                                             797


            1     you went on to answer a series of questions and you actually

            2     said there is no benefit to warming in orthopedic implant

            3     surgery.

            4     A.  I said --

            5     Q.  Do you still stand by that?

            6     A.  -- implant surgery.  I guess I would say two things.

            7     One, there are no data that it reduces surgical site

            8     infection in prosthetic joint implant patients and,

            9     secondly, that normothermia, that there are no studies to

           10     show, as was mentioned at the opening statement, increased

           11     number of deaths, increased number of myocardial

           12     infarctions, increased number of cardiac arrhythmias,

           13     increased number of transfusions.

           14     Q.  Doctor, at the end of your examination yesterday, this

           15     chart with all the big Xs on it now, do you remember that?

           16     A.  Correct.

           17     Q.  And plaintiffs' counsel led you through and asked did

           18     you consider this and why you ruled out this and that and X

           19     and X and it looked like a game show or something.  Several

           20     of the answers or a bit of the reasons why you Xed them out

           21     was because there was no studies that linked whatever it was

           22     to any surgical site infections, right?

           23     A.  That's correct.  I thought we were supposed to meet the

           24     level of more likely than not, not can it ever happen.

           25     Q.  Okay.  Well, I'm going to use the exact same wording



                                   
                                        

                                                                             798


            1     that allowed you to eliminate things.  Dr. Jarvis, have you

            2     ever -- strike that.  Dr. Jarvis, have you seen a single

            3     study in the medical literature based on the hundreds of

            4     articles you have reviewed where a periprosthetic joint

            5     infection was linked back to bacteria that landed on an

            6     implant as a result of the Bair Hugger?

            7     A.  Well, certainly the McGovern study shows an increased

            8     risk of prosthetic joint infections associated with exospore

            9     to the Bair Hugger.  Did they, you know, take pictures, do

           10     electron microscopic examination of the implant, did they

           11     put agar implants in patients, no.

           12     Q.  Dr. Jarvis, I appreciate your not anxious to answer my

           13     questions.  I used the exact same wording that the lawyers

           14     who are paying you used yesterday and you didn't answer

           15     their questions that way.

           16     A.  Well, I --

           17     Q.  Let me try again.

           18               MS. CONLIN:  Object as argumentative Your Honor.

           19               THE COURT:  Sustained.

           20               MR. COREY GORDON:  I withdraw my comment.

           21     BY MR. COREY GORDON:

           22     Q.  Have you seen a single study in the medical literature

           23     based on the hundreds of articles you have reviewed where a

           24     periprosthetic joint infection was linked back to bacteria

           25     that landed on an implant as a result of the Bair Hugger,



                                   
                                        

                                                                             799


            1     yes or no?

            2     A.  Well, there's a lot of steps to that one.  I'm not sure

            3     that it can be answered in a yes or no.  Certainly in the

            4     McGovern study the infections were caused by bacteria, so

            5     that part is yes.  It was linked to exposure to the Bair

            6     Hugger so that is yes, more likely than not it got from the

            7     Bair Hugger to the wound through the air.

            8     Q.  Doctor, you have been saying that it takes only one

            9     bacteria to cause an implant infection, right?

           10     A.  Well, I have said it takes a very small number, maybe as

           11     low as one, certainly animal studies have shown as low as

           12     50.

           13     Q.  You know that Dr. Presnal testified that he can't tell

           14     when the inoculation of the wound occurred, whether during

           15     the surgery, in the immediate days after the surgery, or

           16     even sometime after that?

           17     A.  You'd have to read the question.  I think if you look at

           18     the question the way it was asked, it was really asking him

           19     if you looked at culture plate or you looked at a gram stain

           20     can you tell, and you obviously can't.

           21     Q.  The jury can remember and maybe some of the other

           22     witnesses will take the time to go through it.  Your

           23     recollection is he was asked about looking at the gram stain

           24     that was done in the laboratory.  Is that what you think he

           25     was talking about?



                                   
                                        

                                                                             800


            1     A.  I am saying what I read in his deposition was asking him

            2     basically if you look at the bug, can you tell where it came

            3     from.

            4     Q.  Dr. Jarvis, how is it that you sitting in Hilton Head,

            5     South Carolina, reviewing medical records, can know just

            6     where that one or two or three bacteria that caused

            7     Mr. Gareis's infection came from when you weren't in the

            8     surgery, you didn't treat him afterwards, you didn't take,

            9     do the explanation, you didn't take care of him after --

           10     during that period in the re-implantation?

           11     A.  Because I don't think it would matter if I did all of

           12     those things.  To my knowledge, none of us can see bacteria,

           13     so if we were standing there with Dr. Presnal when he was

           14     doing the surgery, we would not have seen the bacteria on

           15     the skin squames coming up into the operative field and

           16     landing on the prosthetic device.  So standing in that

           17     operating room wouldn't have answered the question.  It's

           18     looking at the composite of all of the data that I've looked

           19     at, including the medical record, including all of the

           20     prevention intervention that Dr. Presnal and his team

           21     implemented in that surgical procedure, together with all of

           22     the various studies that have been done by a wide variety of

           23     people looking at particles and looking at the correlation

           24     between those particles and CFU.

           25               MR. COREY GORDON:  Thank you.  I have nothing

            2               THE COURT:  Ms. Conlin, anything else?

            4                         REDIRECT EXAMINATION

            5     BY MS. CONLIN:

            6     Q.  Good afternoon, Dr. Jarvis.  I'll be brief.  Mr. Gordon

            7     spent a lot of time with you today talking about that

            8     investigation that you did in 1984 to I think it was 1987 as

            9     part of your work at the CDC.  Do you recall that

           10     questioning?

           11     A.  Yes, ma'am.

           12     Q.  Okay.  And you mentioned something about the fact that

           13     the anesthesiologist had contacted the CDC about this

           14     surgeon.  Can you explain how that relates to that study?

           15     A.  Well, it wasn't really the anesthesiologist, it was the

           16     hospital epidemiologist, so the person that did infection

           17     control at that hospital.  They had done some -- been doing

           18     surveillance, so they knew what infection rates were.  They

           19     were calculating surgeon specific infection rates which CDC

           20     has recommended, and they noted that their one surgeon had a

           21     very high rate of infection compared to others and so they

           22     asked us if we could come in and help them evaluate it to

           23     make sure that if they were going to take action against the

           24     surgeon that they had done everything to try to make sure

           25     their assessment was as solid as possible.



                                   
                                        

                                                                            802


            1     Q.  Now, Mr. Gordon asked you some questions about the fact

            2     that you didn't go to -- well, first of all, that you didn't

            3     actually physically examine Mr. Gareis, correct?

            4     A.  Correct, and we didn't in that study either.

            5     Q.  Okay.  But you did rely on experts who did do that,

            6     correct?

            7     A.  Absolutely.  Dr. Stonnington.

            8     Q.  Okay.  And they also talked to you about well, you

            9     didn't go and look at the OR room.  Why would that not have

           10     been helpful in connection with the opinions and the

           11     conclusions that you reached here that the Bair Hugger

           12     caused his infection?

           13     A.  Because by the time I was involved was literally six or

           14     seven years after the surgical procedure had taken place.

           15     Q.  Okay.  Now, you were also asked some questions about the

           16     fact that you put in your report before Dr. Presnal and the

           17     other treating providers at Providence were deposed,

           18     correct?

           19     A.  Correct.

           20     Q.  And was that due to a court timing for when you had to

           21     put in your expert report?

           22               MR. COREY GORDON:  Objection, Your Honor.

                                                                            803


            1     BY MS. CONLIN:

            2     Q.  Do you know, Doctor, whether your -- let me ask it this

            3     way.  Do you know whether the treating physicians had been

            4     deposed at the time you submitted your expert report?

            5     A.  They had not been and I believe in my expert report I

            6     specifically say that there will be other depositions that

            7     might add to my report.

            8     Q.  Okay.  And when you had access to those depositions,

            9     then did you review them?

           10     A.  Yes.

           11     Q.  And did they change your opinions in any way?

           12     A.  They made them even stronger.

           13     Q.  Now, Mr. Gordon also talked to you about some of the

           14     studies, the leg study and the Sessler study, and they asked

           15     you did those studies show causation, meaning that does it

           16     prove a Bair Hugger caused an infection.  Do you recall

           17     that?

           18     A.  Yes.

           19     Q.  Okay.  And I think you indicated that there were

           20     mannequins --

           21     A.  Correct.

           22     Q.  -- in some of those studies?

           23     A.  Yes.

           24     Q.  Can a mannequin get a surgical site infection or a

           25     prosthetic joint infection?



                                   
                                        

                                                                            804


            1     A.  No.

            2     Q.  Okay.  Would it be scientifically unreasonable to find

            3     causation in a study that involved a mannequin as a proxy

            4     for a patient?

            5               MR. COREY GORDON:  Objection.  Leading.

            6               THE COURT:  Sustained.  Redirect, you can't lead.

            7     BY MS. CONLIN:

            8     Q.  What would be your opinion of a scientist who reached a

            9     conclusion of causation based on a study involving a

           10     mannequin?

           11     A.  It wouldn't be believable.

           12     Q.  Okay.  Now Mr. Gordon also talked to you about the

           13     Stocks article.  If you could pull that out, Doctor.  It's

           14     Plaintiffs' Exhibit 27.  And if I can direct you, sir, to

           15     Table 2.  Do you recall that discussion about whether the

           16     microns that are five microns up to ten microns were

           17     statistically significant?  Do you recall that?

           18     A.  Yes.

           19     Q.  Okay.  And I think there was some back and forth

           20     regarding the fact that the authors in that study in the

           21     conclusions talked about ten-micron particles being a proxy

           22     for CFUs, correct?

           23     A.  Correct.

           24     Q.  Okay.  And then if we could take a look at D330, which

           25     was the next exhibit that Mr. Gordon took you to?



                                   
                                        

                                                                            805


            1     A.  P330?

            2     Q.  D330, I believe.

            3     A.  Yes.

            4     Q.  And this was a study that you spent some time talking

            5     with Mr. Gordon about, correct?

            6     A.  Correct.

            7     Q.  And if you could direct your attention, Doctor, to

            8     page 6 of that?

            9     A.  Okay.

           10     Q.  And the first sentence reads, Many studies have argued

           11     that the results of particle count method do not correlate

           12     with bacterial count results.  Do you recall that?  And

           13     there was a discussion between and you Mr. Gordon about the

           14     fact that those studies grouped small particles with large

           15     particles.  Do you recall that?

           16     A.  Yes.

           17               MR. COREY GORDON:  Objection.  Leading Your Honor.

           18               THE COURT:  Overruled.

           19     BY MS. CONLIN:

           20     Q.  And if you could read the next sentence, Doctor?

           21     A.  Only two studies have shown that there's a correlation

           22     between the number of airborne particles and the number of

           23     CFUs.

           24     Q.  And the next sentence, please?

           25     A.  The presence of particles greater than five-micron size

            1     indicate microbiological contamination in the aerosol.

            2     Q.  And what study is listed there along with Seal and

            3     Clark?

            4     A.  Stocks.

            5     Q.  Okay.  Is that the same study that you are argued with

            6     Mr. Gordon about saying that above five microns --

            7               THE COURT:  You need to -- please use the

            8     microphone.

            9               THE WITNESS:  Yes.

           10     BY MS. CONLIN:

           11     Q.  How would you draw the conclusions with respect to

           12     five-micron particles as disclosed in this article in

           13     connection with Stocks?

           14     A.  Would you repeat that, please?

           15     Q.  Sure, sure.  What significance, if any, do you ascribe

           16     to the fact that these authors in plaintiffs' exhibit -- or

           17     Defendants' Exhibit 330, the Mohr article, what significance

           18     do you draw to the fact that they suggested that Stocks was

           19     talking about five-micron and above particles?

           20     A.  That they looked at Table 2 and had the same conclusion

           21     I did.

            1     BY MS. CONLIN:

            2     Q.  Now, how big is a staph epi bacteria, Doctor?

            3     A.  Well, there have been various estimates made but

            4     probably in the 20 or 30-micron range.

            5     Q.  Okay and what was the squeem size, if you recall, that

            6     was used in Dr. Elghobashi's CFD modelling?

            7     A.  I haven't looked at that in a while, but I think it

            8     might have been ten microns.

            9     Q.  Ten microns, okay.  So it correlates to the same size

           10     microns that were found significant in many other studies,

           11     doctor?

           12     A.  In the Stocks studies and Seal and Clark.

           13     Q.  And have you seen literature, Doctor, regarding the fact

           14     that staph epi bacteria can be as small as under one micron?

           15               MR. COREY GORDON:  Objection, Your Honor.

           16     Leading.

           17               THE COURT:  It is leading.  Can you rephrase?

           18     BY MS. CONLIN:

           19     Q.  What are the size -- bacteria can come in different

           20     sizes, right?

           21     A.  Correct.

           22     Q.  And they can attach to particles of different sizes?

           23     A.  Correct.

           24     Q.  Okay.  What are the various sizes that a staph bacteria

           25     can be?



                                   
                                        

                                                                            808


            1     A.  I think they -- I have seen a number of estimates.  Some

            2     have been less than five microns.  Some have been as high as

            3     40 microns, and it probably depends if they are looking at

            4     them head wise or side wise.  They probably vary in size if

            5     they are still growing.

            6     Q.  And finally, Doctor, if you could turn to the Moretti

            7     study, which is Exhibit 727, Plaintiffs' 727?

            8     A.  Okay.

            9     Q.  And I direct your attention to page 3 of that.

           10     A.  Okay.

           11     Q.  And direct your attention to the right-hand column under

           12     results, and if you could read the sentence starting within

           13     the 20 procedures and explain why you think the Moretti

           14     study supports your opinions?

           15               MR. COREY GORDON:  Objection, Your Honor.

           16     Cumulative and leading.

           17               THE COURT:  I'll allow it.

           18               Go ahead and answer, if you can.

           19     BY MS. CONLIN:

           20     Q.  If you could read that, Doctor?

           21     A.  In the 20 procedures in which the Bair Hugger was used,

           22     the main bacterial load values were significantly increased

           23     in the three points compared with the at risk conditions.

           24     And then they give a series of numbers for all of the

           25     various points where they were doing testing and all of them



                                   
                                        

                                                                            809


            1     are highly statistically significant and less than .001

            2     level.

            3     Q.  Okay.  Now, and how does that support your opinion,

            4     Doctor?

            5     A.  That when the Bair Hugger is on, the particle

            6     contamination bacterial load is significantly higher than

            7     when it was not on.

            8     Q.  Now, finally, I want to direct your attention to a

            9     couple of the exhibits that you were directed to today by

           10     defendant.  If we can look at D961.

           11     A.  Okay.

           12     Q.  And I think you wanted to say something about Table 2 in

           13     that study, which is on page 3.

           14     A.  Yeah, just to reemphasize that the -- as I mentioned and

           15     agreed earlier, that the -- this is the one where both the

           16     normothermic and the hypothermic, both had exposure to Bair

           17     Hugger, so it's not a Bair Hugger yes or Bair Hugger no,

           18     everybody had Bair Hugger.  That the estimated blood loss in

           19     those that were hypothermic versus normothermic was greater

           20     but the intraoperative administration of blood which is like

           21     you would think would be a risk factor for getting a

           22     surgical site infection was no different between the two.

           23     So one group bled a little bit more than the other.  And

           24     remember that those are estimated blood losses and often

           25     physicians make that estimate and it sometimes can be almost



                                   
                                        

                                                                            810


            1     rote 200 or 500.  So I'm not sure if they measured that

            2     precisely versus estimating it.  But regardless, even though

            3     they had more blood loss, they did not have more blood

            4     transfusions which is what one argues blood transfusions

            5     impact the immune system that leads to greater risk for

            6     infection.  It's not the blood loss; it's the transfusion.

            7     Q.  All right.  I would like to direct your attention to

            8     Plaintiffs' Exhibit 528.  It should be in your book?

            9     A.  528?

           10     Q.  Yes, Plaintiffs' 528?

           11     A.  Oh, plaintiffs.  Wrong book.  Okay.

           12     Q.  What's the title of this article, doctor?

           13     A.  Intraoperative Hypothermia in Total Hip and Knee

           14     Arthroplasty.

           15     Q.  And is this the Frisch article you were talking about

           16     yesterday?

           17     A.  Yes.

           18     Q.  Okay.  And where was it published?

           19     A.  Oh, in Orthopedics in 2017.

           20     Q.  Okay.  And do you consider that authoritative?

           21     A.  Yes.

           22     Q.  Okay.  Your Honor -- and did you rely on it in

           23     connection with your opinions in this case?

           24     A.  Yes.

           25               MS. CONLIN:  Your Honor, we would offer

            1     Plaintiffs' Exhibit 528 under 803(18).

            2               MR. COREY GORDON:  Your Honor, I think my

            3     objection is beyond the scope of cross.

            4               THE COURT:  If there's a particular part of that

            5     that you want to call his attention to, go ahead and do

            6     that.

            7               MS. CONLIN:  Absolutely, Your Honor.

            8     BY MS. CONLIN:

            9     Q.  If you can direct your attention to page 5, Dr. Jarvis.

           10     A.  Yes.

           11     Q.  There's a number of tables there, correct?  Univariate

           12     analysis of complications associated with hypothermia?

           13     A.  Correct.

           14     Q.  Okay.  Would publishing this assist in explaining your

           15     conclusions regarding any issues with hypothermia --

           16     A.  Yes.

           17     Q.  -- to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury?

           18     A.  Yes.

           19               MS. CONLIN:  Your Honor, I would ask permission to

           20     publish this page of this study.

           21               THE COURT:  All right.

           22     BY MS. CONLIN:

           23     Q.  If we can put up 528, page 5.

           24               And it's kind of hard to read, Doctor, but --

           25     A.  This is a study of a large number, over 2500 total joint



                                   
                                        

                                                                            812


            1     procedure patients, and they are looking at a variety of

            2     complications and looking at normothermia versus

            3     hypothermia, the issue being does normothermia -- or does

            4     hypothermia lead to some of these complications.

            5               So they are looking at myocardial infarction.

            6     Right there.  Whoops.  So myocardial infarction there, not

            7     significant.  Stroke, not significant.  DVT is deep vein

            8     thrombosis, not significant.  PE is pulmonary embolism, not

            9     significant.  DSSI is deep surgical site infection, not

           10     significant.  SSSI, superficial surgical site infection, not

           11     significant.  Length of stay, not significant.

           12               So in this very large study of both total knee and

           13     total hip procedure patients none of these complications

           14     were found to be more common in those that were hypothermic

           15     than normothermic.

           16     Q.  And was this one of the studies that you relied on for

           17     the statements that you made regarding any perceived

           18     benefits of normothermia during hip procedures such as Mr.

           19     Gareis's?

           20     A.  Yes.

           21               MS. CONLIN:  Thank you.  I have no further

           22     questions.

           23               THE COURT:  Mr. Gordon.

           24               MR. COREY GORDON:  I will try to be very brief,

           25     Your Honor.

            1                         RECROSS-EXAMINATION

            2     BY MR. COREY GORDON:

            3     Q.  I will start out with that last study you looked at, the

            4     P528.

            5     A.  Okay.

            6     Q.  You just went through that table of data and gave your

            7     summary of all the things that you say it says, right?  In

            8     the Abstract on page 1, the second to the last sentence,

            9     Overall, hypothermia was associated with increased blood

           10     loss, but no increase in associated transfusion was

           11     demonstrated.  Did I read that correctly?

           12     A.  Yes.

           13     Q.  And this was in total hip and knee arthroplasty, right?

           14     A.  Correct.

           15     Q.  And when you went through these tables, you didn't say

           16     anything about the blood loss, did you?

           17     A.  Well, blood loss, the reason that blood loss would

           18     potentially be important is because it leads to blood

           19     transfusions, which we found was not significantly

           20     different.  Blood transfusions, as Dr. Wentzel in his report

           21     talked about, have the potential to impact the ability of

           22     the immune system to fight through infection and

           23     theoretically makes infection more likely.  So if you have a

           24     blood loss, but you don't get a blood transfusion, that

           25     blood loss does not have any impact on your immune system



                                   
                                        

                                                                             814


            1     and risks.  Blood loss alone has never been found to be a

            2     risk factor for surgical site infection, much less deep

            3     surgical site infection.

            4     Q.  And the transfusion risk that you are talking about,

            5     you're -- it's your understanding that allogeneic is a

            6     person's own blood?

            7     A.  Well, a transfusion can be either allogeneic or

            8     non-allogeneic.  And it's the non-allogeneic that are going

            9     to lead to the bigger risks for immune modification, and

           10     that's why they move toward allogeneic, but in this case the

           11     transfusion was not significant in any respect.

           12     Q.  So just, I'm just -- your understanding is allogeneic

           13     means your own blood?

           14     A.  Correct.

           15     Q.  Okay.  Turn to page -- Exhibit P727.

           16     A.  Moretti?

           17     Q.  Yeah.  Risk of sounding a little bit like Ground Hog

           18     Day.  You read again today that paragraph about the

           19     difference between the empty at-rest theatre and the Bair

           20     Hugger on, right?

           21     A.  Right.

           22     Q.  You weren't asked to say anything again about what

           23     happened in between and how the numbers actually went much

           24     higher when people went in the room and then went down when

           25     the Bair Hugger was turned on, right?



                                   
                                        

                                                                             815


            1     A.  Right.

            2     Q.  And if you look at the front --

            3     A.  And, again, I would point out that the two -- it's

            4     interesting that the papers that tend to find that the

            5     counts do not go up tend to always have their sampling areas

            6     in the same place, around the edge of the room, which is

            7     really pretty irrelevant, and next to the axilla on both

            8     sides.  And if my hip is down here and I'm testing up here,

            9     it may not really be reflective of what is important for

           10     that total hip arthroplasty procedure exposure.  And

           11     virtually three studies have the same setup of where they

           12     test and they're the ones that show either no increase or

           13     small increase.

           14     Q.  The front page of Moretti or the authors of the study

           15     are interpreting their data say at the bottom, "Statistical

           16     analysis of the results demonstrated that the Bair Hugger

           17     system does not pose a real risk for nosocomial infections,

           18     whereas it does offer the advantage of preventing the

           19     potentially very severe consequences of hypothermia during

           20     major orthopedic surgery."  Did I read that correctly?

           21     A.  Yeah.  And it definitely overstates what their study

           22     said.  They didn't look at all nosocomial infections.  So

           23     how would they know?  That suggests that it would reduce

           24     urinary tract infections and ventilator-associated

           25     pneumonias, et cetera, et cetera, and they didn't even look



                                   
                                        

                                                                             816


            1     at that.

            2     Q.  It was actually a yes-or-no question, but I just have

            3     one more question.  But you said that somebody relying on a

            4     study involving a mannequin to form an opinion, that

            5     wouldn't be believable, right?  You just said that, right?

            6     A.  Right.  They said based upon a mannequin study that it

            7     causes infection.  They could say more likely it might cause

            8     it, but they can't say for sure.

            9     Q.  Would you say that would also be unbelievable if

           10     somebody relied on a computer-generated depiction of a

           11     mannequin to come to a causation opinion?

           12     A.  I don't think so.  When you consider the fact that the

           13     airplane that I'm getting on this afternoon is basically

           14     designed as a result of such mathematical modeling, computer

           15     modeling, I would hope they do it right.

           16     Q.  You kind of hope they also test it by actually trying to

           17     fly it before you get on it, right?

           18     A.  Test --

           19     Q.  The airplane.

           20     A.  Well, the design of the airplane is based upon the

           21     modeling, computer modeling.  Presumably they test it after.

           22     And I think all of us wish that 3M had done the tests that

           23     Dr. Sessler wanted to do because if they did, we would have

           24     an answer today.

           25               MR. COREY GORDON:  Thank you.  No further



                                   
                                        

                                                                             817


            1     questions.

            2               THE COURT:  All right.  I think we're done.

            3               MS. CONLIN:  Yeah.  May we just approach briefly?

            4               THE COURT:  You may step down.

            5               Members of the jury, we are most likely going to

            6     be in recess for the weekend, but let me just talk to the

            7     lawyers here for one moment.

            8               THE CLERK:  All rise.

            9               THE COURT:  No, no.

           10               Yes, sure, you can leave, but don't leave the

           11     building.  I'm going to come back and tell you about the

           12     schedule.  How about that?

           13               (In open court without the jury present.)

           14               THE COURT:  All right.  Please be seated.

           15               Next week we will --

           16               Dr. Jarvis, you may step down.

           17               THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

           18                        (Witness steps down.)

           19               THE COURT:  Next week we will be in session the

           20     regular 9 to 4:30 on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.  Tuesday

           21     we will conclude by 1:15 or 1:30.  And then Thursday we will

           22     do another -- so Tuesday will be a compressed day,

           23     compressed into the morning, and Thursday will be a

           24     compressed day again, as was yesterday compressed in the

           25     afternoon, so starting at noon.



                                   
                                        

                                                                             818


            1               MR. CIRESI:  Your Honor.  Your Honor.

            2               THE COURT:  Yeah, I hear you.  Just a second.  All

            3     right.  Who is -- Mr. Ciresi.

            4               MR. CIRESI:  Yes, Your Honor.  On Tuesday, for

            5     those of us going to Judge Murphy's funeral, and I assume

            6     that's why we are recessing early, can we do it at 1:15?

            7     Because I am told that it's going to be really a filled

            8     church.  So for those of us who are going to get there and

            9     get seated, it might be helpful if we can leave at 1:15.

           10     That's all I request.

           11               THE COURT:  All right.  Ms. Conlin, did you have

           12     something?

           13               MS. CONLIN:  Yes.  Three issues, Your Honor.

           14               THE COURT:  Let me just get back to Mr. Ciresi's

           15     point.  Should we start at 8 on Tuesday?

           16               MS. CONLIN:  That would be fine with us.

           17               MR. CIRESI:  Fine with us, Your Honor.

           18               THE COURT:  Just a second.  Let me see if that's

           19     even possible from our perspective.  No.  We will still

           20     start at 9.

           21               Okay, Ms. Conlin.

           22               MS. CONLIN:  Yes.  Thank you, Your Honor.  Two

           23     issues.  One is I want to make an offer of proof with

           24     respect to Dr. Jarvis's testimony.

           25               THE COURT:  Okay.  Go ahead.



                                   
                                        

                                                                             819


            1               MS. CONLIN:  The first issue is we believe that

            2     Mr. Gordon opened the door in connection with having him

            3     read from an article.  And actually I had coached him to

            4     make sure he didn't read it.  And he stopped, and Mr. Gordon

            5     said would you please continue, so he read about the fact

            6     that the machines are dirty.  And it wasn't -- I mean, it

            7     was brought out on cross-examination.  The witness stopped;

            8     Mr. Gordon asked him to.  And so we do think that's opened

            9     the door on the dirty machine piece, because the witness

           10     didn't go on, he stopped, he didn't know what to do, and Mr.

           11     Gordon insisted that he read the rest of the paragraph,

           12     which included that there were significant bacteria cultured

           13     in the machine at the end of the host.

           14               So we believe that that door has been reopened.

           15     If so, Dr. Jarvis would have testified with respect to

           16     Plaintiffs' Exhibit 92, which showed that 58 percent of the

           17     forced air warmings tested had airborne contaminants,

           18     including CoNS, the very bacteria that Mr. Gareis was

           19     diagnosed as having in his PJI, as well as Plaintiffs'

           20     Exhibit 98, which found the same thing, significant levels

           21     of internally-generated airborne contaminants, including

           22     CoNS, which is the bacteria that caused Mr. Gareis's

           23     infection, and P91, which cultured 25 in-use Bair Hugger

           24     forced air warmings and found that 24 percent of those were

           25     emitting significant levels of internally-generated airborne



                                   
                                        

                                                                             820


            1     contamination in the .5 to 5 microns size, as well as that

            2     microorganisms were detected in the internal pathways of

            3     94 percent of the blowers, including CoNS, which is the bug

            4     that caused Mr. Gareis's infection.

            5               In addition, we would -- had he been allowed, Dr.

            6     Jarvis would have testified consistent with his expert

            7     report, which I believe, Your Honor, is already an exhibit,

            8     so I won't go through that, but the exhibits that we would

            9     offer with respect to the testimony on the heater cooler,

           10     would have been Plaintiffs' Exhibit 742, Plaintiffs'

           11     Exhibit 817, Plaintiffs' Exhibit 811, Plaintiffs'

           12     Exhibit 753, Plaintiffs' Exhibit 772, Plaintiffs'

           13     Exhibit 786, Plaintiffs' Exhibits 812 and 827 and 832.

           14               THE COURT:  Okay.  That's 742, 817, 811, 753, 772,

           15     786, 812, 827 and 831?

           16               MS. CONLIN:  832, Your Honor.

           17               THE COURT:  Not 831?

           18               MS. CONLIN:  No, Your Honor.

           19               THE COURT:  Thank you very much.

           20               MS. CONLIN:  And then finally, Your Honor, during

           21     the deposition testimony of Dr. Kurz yesterday, she

           22     testified regarding a document, which is Plaintiffs'

           23     Exhibit 247.  In light of her testimony, we would offer 247

           24     into evidence.

           25               THE COURT:  Anybody on this side have a response?



                                   
                                        

                                                                             821


            1               MR. BLACKWELL:  Yes, Your Honor, we oppose.  This

            2     document is not one, in fact, she read from on the

            3     testimony; she was simply shown it by plaintiffs' counsel.

            4     It's going back again to these emails again.  It's an

            5     attempt to get at 3M corporate conduct as Plaintiffs'

            6     Exhibit 247.  It's an email primarily by Dan Sessler, and we

            7     object to it.

            8               THE COURT:  Oh, it's not a study.  Okay.  So it's

            9     not an -- it's not an 803(18), with respect to Kurz?

           10               MR. BLACKWELL:  No, no, Your Honor.  It's

           11     definitely a 402 and hearsay.

           12               THE COURT:  Just a second.

           13               Ms. Conlin, is it an email or is it a scientific

           14     study?

           15               MS. CONLIN:  I will hand it to your clerk, Your

           16     Honor.

           17               THE COURT:  Well, is it --

           18               MS. CONLIN:  It's an email.

           19               THE COURT:  Okay.  All right.  The objection is

           20     sustained.

           21               MS. CONLIN:  An email talking about results, which

           22     we think is a business record.  It's a communication between

           23     Dr. Sessler and 3M.  It was produced in the ordinary course

           24     of business and produced out of 3M's files.

           25               MR. BLACKWELL:  Your Honor, I think we have been



                                   
                                        

                                                                             822


            1     heard on it.

            2               THE COURT:  Mr. Gordon, what about this

            3     opening-the-door argument that is based on the reading of

            4     the paragraph of exhibit -- I'm sorry.  I can't remember

            5     the --

            6               MR. COREY GORDON:  If it's all right with the

            7     court, I'm going to ask my colleague Mr. Hulse to address

            8     this.

            9               THE COURT:  All right.

           10               MR. HULSE:  Thank you, Your Honor.  I was immersed

           11     in opening-the-door cases last night and responding to the

           12     plaintiffs' motions so that's why I'm stepping up.

           13               But one doesn't open the door when the other

           14     side's expert gives testimony that is adverse to oneself.

           15     If we'd elicited favorable testimony on a subject that's

           16     been excluded, possibly that could open the door.

           17               The actual circumstances of this also were that

           18     twice, not asked by Mr. Gordon, not questions prompted by

           19     questions, he twice in his testimony volunteered dirty

           20     machines statements, despite the ostensible preparation not

           21     to.  And then in the study, when Mr. Gordon asked him to

           22     read the next line, he read the next line and then continued

           23     on to the dirty machines line.  That's at least when I

           24     looked at the transcript what it looked like.

           25               But, in any event, these were prompted by the



                                   
                                        

                                                                             823


            1     plaintiffs' own expert.  He did it repeatedly.  And we don't

            2     open the door when we do that, when he does that.  And like

            3     I said, when we -- because he answers a question, gives

            4     testimony that's adverse to us on a subject, that doesn't

            5     open the door for the plaintiffs to simply bring in more

            6     evidence adverse to us.

            7               And then the last point I make is simply what the

            8     court has already ruled on this, is that when the plaintiffs

            9     were put on the record to offer evidence that the Bair

           10     Hugger system actually emits bacteria through the blanket,

           11     bacteria that's been harbored inside it or pulled up, the

           12     court reached the conclusion that there wasn't a fact in

           13     dispute about it, that the plaintiffs had not offered a

           14     scientific fact, despite extensive resources spent on it,

           15     despite extensive expert testimony to support the fact so

           16     they couldn't pursue the theory.  So there's no fact to come

           17     through the door.

           18               Thank you, Your Honor.

           19               THE COURT:  All right.  The prior rulings will

           20     remain in effect.

           21               And so we are concluded with Dr. Jarvis's

           22     testimony, meaning that we can let the jury know that they

           23     are free to go for the day.

           24               MS. CONLIN:  There was one other issue on Dr.

           25     Jarvis, Your Honor.



                                   
                                        

                                                                             824


            1               THE COURT:  That you already, did you already talk

            2     about it or is it a new one?

            3               MS. CONLIN:  No.  It was -- I made a motion, and I

            4     tried to head it off when they --

            5               THE COURT:  Could you just -- like what is it that

            6     you want to say?

            7               MS. CONLIN:  I want to say that I tried to head

            8     off Mr. Gordon's statement -- or question to Dr. Jarvis

            9     about the fact that the FDA had concluded or made certain

           10     conclusions with respect to the Bair Hugger, that I asked to

           11     have that question stricken from the record, but it -- you

           12     know, we may be water over the bridge at this point.

           13               THE COURT:  I don't recall a request to strike.  I

           14     do recall that there was FDA mentioned in a question.  And

           15     as I said at the bench, I allowed that question because I

           16     didn't think it was going to lead to a whole line of

           17     questioning directly on the FDA.  Dr. Jarvis mentioned the

           18     FDA and that committee in his direct, so that's why that

           19     question was allowed.  And further questioning was objected

           20     to and that objection was sustained, but I do not recall

           21     that there was a motion to strike.

           22               MS. CONLIN:  And I'll have to check the

           23     transcript, Your Honor.  It was just the last housekeeping

           24     issue on Dr. Jarvis.

           25               THE COURT:  Okay.  We have got a juror who has to



                                   
                                        

                                                                             825


            1     leave at 2:30.

            2               MS. CONLIN:  Okay.

            3               THE COURT:  So would somebody -- and actually I

            4     have a -- I have an 8:00 meeting on Monday.  So I think

            5     safest to say start at 9:30, rather than 9, on Monday, just

            6     because that meeting might go a little bit longer.

            7               So would one of you just go --

            8               Well, here, let me finish.  I will tell the

            9     lawyers one more thing, and then we will be in recess.

           10               There's a lot of evidence on both sides about this

           11     benefit, that the cost benefit analysis.  My question to you

           12     both, and I'm not asking for an answer, I am just telling

           13     you, that I will give you a chance to brief the relevance of

           14     that under South Carolina law, if you do not feel that you

           15     have already briefed it.

           16               There was some talk about that in the summary

           17     judgment briefs.  There was some discussion I think in the

           18     choice of law briefs.  But given the amount of time and

           19     energy everybody is spending on it, I just want to make sure

           20     that you have a chance to really articulate your various

           21     positions on whether South Carolina looks at the -- would

           22     look at the benefit of no warming versus this warming, or

           23     does South Carolina look at the accused product and compare

           24     it to the proposed -- to the alternative, because Minnesota

           25     and South Carolina law may or may not be the same on that.



                                   
                                        

                                                                             826


            1               So you don't have to write any more briefs, but

            2     perhaps you want to think about it, and I just wanted to

            3     raise that before the weekend or -- I'm not saying you need

            4     to have briefs on Monday, but -- so there's that.

            5               And with that, we will be in recess.  And I'm

            6     going to tell the jury that we are going to resume at 9:30

            7     on Monday and then we will proceed with that schedule.

            8               THE CLERK:  All rise.
