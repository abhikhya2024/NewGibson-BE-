            4               THE COURT:  Welcome back, everybody.  Please be

            5     seated.  And we'll have Dr. Stonnington back on the witness

            6     stand.  You're still under oath from yesterday.

            7               THE WITNESS:  Yes, Your Honor.

            8               THE COURT:  And, Mr. Farrar, whenever you're

            9     ready.

           10                        REDIRECT EXAMINATION

           11     BY MR. FARRAR:

           12     Q.  Doctor, welcome back.  I have a few questions just

           13     followups.  We're going to be pretty short.  I want to talk

           14     to you about some of the other equipment that Ms. Pruitt

           15     talked to you about yesterday that's in the operating room.

           16     And if we're going to pull up the operating room, if you

           17     would do that, 1606.  This is just a kind of a mock --

           18     demonstrative.

           19               But she talked about an anesthesia machine.  If

           20     you just kind of point to where an anesthesia machine would

           21     be located.

           22     A.  It would be at either end of the table depending on

           23     what's the head or the -- you can use the table, the table

           24     has either got a head and a foot side, but you can actually

           25     switch them around.  We sometimes do for certain different




                                                                            504



            1     types of operations, so anesthesia can be received from

            2     either side.

            3     Q.  Does the anesthesia machine blow air from the unsterile

            4     field on the patient?

            5     A.  No, it doesn't.  In fact, the back of the anesthesia

            6     machine is where the air comes out of, and it's typically in

            7     every OR I've been in it's aimed away from the sterile field

            8     and that it's going towards the returns the exhaust fans

            9     where the air goes out.

           10     Q.  She asked you about electrocautery machine, is that also

           11     called a Bovie?

           12     A.  Yes, sir.

           13     Q.  What is a Bovie and where is it?

           14     A.  A bovie is basically a hot knife.  And it's --

           15               THE COURT:  How do you spell Bovie?  Like a Bovie

           16     knife?

           17               THE WITNESS:  It's b-o-v-i-e.

           18               THE COURT:  Oh, Bovie, not a boning.

           19     A.  Yeah, it's not a bowie knife or however you want to say

           20     it.  It's not a Texas knife, I guess.  It's a various thin

           21     pointed device that it heats up, and you can basically cut

           22     tissues and cauterize bleeding while you're going down, but

           23     you don't use it the whole way down either.  I use a

           24     combination.  I use a lot of dissection with my fingers.

           25     Q.  When you say "dissection," what do you mean?




                                                                            505



            1     A.  When I'm going through tissues, I use my fingers.  I

            2     used that a lot.  It's a very safe way to protect vital

            3     structures because my fingers are unable to cut a nerve or a

            4     vessel, and so it's a very safe technique to use, when you

            5     can use it, you should use it, and but the electrocautery or

            6     the Bovie is attached via a cord to a device outside of the

            7     sterile field.

            8     Q.  Does it blow air from the unsterile field on to the

            9     patient?

           10     A.  No, it does not.

           11     Q.  You talked about -- she asked you some questions about

           12     the lights that are up above the patient.  Do you recall

           13     that?

           14     A.  Yes, sir.

           15     Q.  All right.  Do the lights blow air from the unsterile

           16     field on to the patient?

           17     A.  No, they do not.

           18     Q.  She asked you about a portable x-ray machine, if that

           19     was, first of all, was there a portable x-ray machine used

           20     in Mr. Gareis' surgery?

           21     A.  There was not.

           22     Q.  If there was one, where would it be?

           23     A.  It would be where -- I don't want to sound like a smart

           24     aleck, but it would be where it needed to be and that is

           25     depending on where you were x-raying, you would bring it




                                                                            506



            1     into whatever side of the table.  One thing you do with an

            2     x-ray machine is you cover it with a sterile drape and one

            3     of the things you're taught, the surgery techs, which are

            4     really vital to successful surgeries, and I'm proud to

            5     always have them on my team because they are true

            6     professionals, they know how to drape these x-ray machines

            7     and keep them from injuring the patient.

            8     Q.  Not that it was used in Mr. Gareis's, but if there was

            9     one, does a portable x-ray machine blow air from the

           10     unsterile field onto the patient?

           11     A.  No, it does not.

           12     Q.  From your review of the medical records, deposition

           13     testimony, everything you reviewed, was there anything in

           14     Mr. Gareis's surgery that took air from the unsterile field

           15     and blew it on to Mr. Gareis?

           16     A.  Was there anything in his surgery that took -- the

           17     question is was there anything in his surgery?

           18     Q.  Right?

           19     A.  That took unsterile air and caused it to go into the

           20     wound?

           21     Q.  Well, blew it on to Mr. Gareis.

           22     A.  Well, in my opinion the Bair Hugger.

           23     Q.  Is that the only thing?

           24     A.  That's the only thing.

           25     Q.  You were asked some questions about the number of folks




                                                                            507



            1     in Mr. Gareis's surgery.  And I think the count was ten

            2     total, obviously, not at the same time.  Do you remember

            3     that?

            4     A.  That's correct.

            5     Q.  I want to talk about what the standard of care is for a

            6     total hip replacement surgery for the number of folks in the

            7     operating room.  When you do your surgeries, how many people

            8     are there with you?  And if you could just kind of list out

            9     who they are.

           10     A.  So, typically, with a hip replacement, you're going to

           11     have a surgeon.  You're going to have a scrub nurse or

           12     surgery tech that's on the table.  The surgery tech is on

           13     the table, table-side handing instruments.  You're going to

           14     have across from you an assistant, which could be also

           15     surgery techs.  Surgery techs are trained to be assistants

           16     as well.  And then often you'll have your own assistant, in

           17     my case, and in many cases, it's a physician assistant or a

           18     nurse practitioner, so that would be four.

           19     Q.  And is that consistent with what Mr. Gareis had?

           20     A.  Yes, it is.

           21     Q.  Okay.  Who else would be in the operating room for you?

           22     A.  In addition, you will have an anesthesia person who is

           23     either a nurse anesthetist or an anesthesia doctor, an MD,

           24     DO.

           25     Q.  Let me ask you about that, a nurse anesthetist, do they




                                                                            508



            1     have a supervisor?

            2     A.  They do.

            3     Q.  Who is their supervisor?

            4     A.  Typically, they do.  So they typically are supervised by

            5     an MD or a DO anesthesia doctor.

            6     Q.  In your surgeries, is it common for the

            7     anesthesiologist, the MD, to come check on a patient who is

            8     being treated by a CRNA, a nurse anesthetist?

            9     A.  It's not only common, it's standard.

           10     Q.  Standard of care?

           11     A.  That's right.  It happens in virtually every joint

           12     replacement that I do.

           13     Q.  So the fact that the anesthesiologist came into the room

           14     for Mr. Gareis to check on the nurse anesthetist is not

           15     unusual?

           16     A.  No, in fact it's part of their protocol.

           17     Q.  And then there was, well, there was a discussion that

           18     the treating nurse anesthetist had to take break?

           19     A.  May I just say --

           20     Q.  Yes.

           21     A.  -- protocols that I've seen.

           22     Q.  Okay.

           23     A.  So it could be different at other places, but that is

           24     typically what you do, the MD checks on the nurse

           25     anesthetist.




                                                                            509



            1     Q.  The nurse anesthetist took a break, is that unusual in

            2     your practice?

            3     A.  That's very common.  That's usual.  In fact, it's a

            4     running joke among surgeons that we make fun of them

            5     anesthesia folks because they always have to have a lunch

            6     break, and they always have to have bathroom breaks and

            7     that's what they do.  And, you know, they're working all

            8     day.  At least after I get done with a case, I can go sit

            9     down in the lounge, but they actually, they got to keep

           10     getting patients back, so they rightfully deserve to have

           11     the breaks, but we make fun of them for that.

           12               But that's what they do.  So when they need to go

           13     to the bathroom, they get relieved.  When they need to go to

           14     the lunch, they get relieved, and that's standard care

           15     across America.

           16     Q.  Is there anything unusual about it?

           17     A.  There's nothing unusual about it.

           18     Q.  There was questions regarding a rep from the

           19     manufacturer of the prosthesis in the room?

           20     A.  Correct.

           21     Q.  Do you typically have reps in the room when you're doing

           22     hip replacement surgery?

           23     A.  For joint replacements every case.

           24     Q.  Why?

           25     A.  The representative knows all the vital points about the




                                                                            510



            1     prosthesis, so when you're putting this in, they know where

            2     the boxes are that contain the components that are a few

            3     millimeters different.  They can answer questions about

            4     factory specifications that may or may not be right on the

            5     -- might not be available to the surgeon right there other

            6     than through the representative.  They make sure that the

            7     prosthesis is the correct box is being chosen to open for

            8     the surgery.

            9               They, in my practice, they will come into my

           10     clinic, and they will look at the x-rays of the patients I'm

           11     about to operate.  They'll make measurements and go over the

           12     case, and we'll come up with a plan for the next day.

           13     They're actually a really vital part of the joint

           14     replacement care, and so that is typical for them to be in

           15     the room.

           16     Q.  Would you consider it part of the standard of care?

           17     A.  It is definitely part of the standard of care.

           18     Q.  So the number of folks in Mr. Gareis's surgery, is that

           19     consistent with the number of people that are in and out of

           20     the surgeries that you do?

           21     A.  That is, yes, that's typical.  And we're not at a point

           22     in medicine where we're sitting, going to have, you know,

           23     maybe one day, you know, maybe we'll be this space ship

           24     society where we're going to have surgeons sitting in

           25     control rooms with joy sticks.  We're going to have robots,




                                                                            511



            1     everything is sterile, and no human is going in and out.

            2     But right now the best we have is what you just described,

            3     and we have to work with that.  And so that's why we create

            4     an OR to diminish the effects of that.  And just because

            5     it's like that, it's not a license to make it worse.

            6     Q.  When you say you create an OR to combat the effects,

            7     what are you talking about?

            8     A.  Going back to Sir John Charnley, who was knighted over

            9     his work on this, creating unidirectional airflow that

           10     protects the patient via this force field of getting the

           11     particles, the skin cells that are floating, the dust that

           12     is floating getting away from the patient and out to the

           13     return vents.  And that's one of the reasons, that's the

           14     main reason we have that because we have to have human

           15     activity in the operating room.  I have to be able to move

           16     my arms to do a surgery.  I have to have a scrub nurse who

           17     can go from table to handing me an instrument.  I have to

           18     have a circulator who can go get things that are necessary.

           19     It's -- the anesthesiologists have to take breaks.  Those

           20     are all the things that are standard of care, but it's not a

           21     license to make things worse.

           22     Q.  You were asked a question about whether the patient's

           23     skin is a major source of bacteria.  And you wanted to give

           24     an explanation, and you didn't get a chance to, but you do

           25     now, so I want to let you explain what you wanted to say




                                                                            512



            1     about that to the jury, please.

            2     A.  So the skin is a major source of bacteria.  And as far

            3     as it being a significant source, it's a significant source

            4     from the standpoint that there's not just the skin cells on

            5     your skin.  We deal with the skin cells on your skin with

            6     the prep.  It's the skin cells like I talked about in this

            7     room.  It's the skin cells in the air, it's the skin cells

            8     on the floor.  Those are in addition to the skin cells that

            9     are on your skin.  It's what makes it significant is we have

           10     to figure out how to control the skin cells that are not

           11     controllable.  And those are the -- and the best we can do

           12     to make them controllable is through unidirectional air.  We

           13     control the skin cells on the skin through our prep and we

           14     try our best to control the skin cells through this

           15     unidirectional air through this force field which takes

           16     those cells, those particulates, that dust and pushes it out

           17     through the return vents and protects the patient, and so

           18     that's what I meant.  Those skin cells carry bacteria.  A

           19     significant percentage of them carry bacteria.

           20     Q.  The prosthesis, can you hold that up?  How does a

           21     bacteria get from wherever it is on a skin cell onto that

           22     prosthesis during a surgery?

           23     A.  If you didn't have that force field protection from the

           24     unidirectional air, the skin cells can actually come up from

           25     the floor in the air and do that (witness indicates.)




                                                                            513



            1     Q.  Is that called airborne contamination?

            2     A.  That's airborne contamination, and that is through

            3     decades of research, that is the source of intraoperative

            4     infections.

            5     Q.  Can bacteria, do they have -- this is maybe a silly

            6     question, but do they have legs?  Can they walk or jump?

            7     A.  They have to have a vector, and the vector is something

            8     that carries it to them.  And it's the air, it's the air

            9     carrying it to them.  So you have to have a way to control

           10     the air, to control those skin cells from getting on to the

           11     prosthesis and that's what we do.  We control it through the

           12     unidirectional air.

           13     Q.  So if you're putting in a prosthesis like that into

           14     someone like Mr. Gareis, is it possible for bacteria that's

           15     on his skin while you're putting it in to jump on to the

           16     prosthesis?

           17     A.  Jump on it by itself?

           18     Q.  Right.

           19     A.  No, it's not.  It needs something to bring it there.

           20     And what's interesting is when you prep a patient's skin,

           21     the Darouiche study from 2010 the New England Journal of

           22     Medicine, a significant study, it showed that when you prep

           23     a patient's skin with the best we have, which right now is

           24     in my opinion ChloraPrep, which I use, that showed a

           25     decrease infection rate at the skin level.  It didn't show a




                                                                            514



            1     decrease infection rate at the deep joint.  So it shows that

            2     it's the air infecting the deep joint.  It's not the skin

            3     because if it had been the skin, that study would have shown

            4     an increased infection rate of deep joints, and it didn't.

            5     Q.  So airborne contamination is what infects people for

            6     deep joint infections?

            7     A.  Airborne contamination dating back decades, decades of

            8     research.

            9               MR. FARRAR:  Your Honor, may I approach?

           10               THE COURT:  You may.

           11     BY MR. FARRAR:

           12     Q.  The international consensus we talked about yesterday

           13     from both I asked you some questions and Ms. Pruitt asked

           14     you some questions about it, and this is the group of four

           15     hundred or so that get together every couple of years and

           16     discuss the best practices to prevent deep joint infections,

           17     correct?

           18     A.  Yes, sir.

           19     Q.  And I think I asked you this, but you find it

           20     authoritative and relied on it for opinions in this case,

           21     right?

           22     A.  I did.

           23               MR. FARRAR:  I'm going to ask questions on this,

           24     do you have any objection?

           25               MS. PRUITT:  No.  It's not that I don't want to.




                                                                            515



            1     BY MR. FARRAR:

            2     Q.  I want to, it's sort of a thick book, but I'm going to

            3     turn your attention if you would on the bottom to page 115.

            4     A.  I think I found it this time.

            5               MS. PRUITT:  Which number is that?

            6               MR. FARRAR:   It's question 2 on page 115.

            7               MS. PRUITT:  Where is the page?

            8               THE WITNESS:  Oh, I see it.

            9     BY MR. FARRAR:

           10     Q.  Do you see where I'm looking, do you see question 2?

           11     A.  I do.

           12     Q.  All right.  What's question 2 say?

           13     A.  "Do numbers of bacteria in the operating room

           14     environment correlate directly with the probability of SSI?

           15     Surgical site infection.

           16     Q.  And can you read what the consensus --

           17               REPORTER:  I'm sorry.

           18     A.  SSI means surgery site infection.

           19     Q.  And if you would read what the consensus is?

           20     A.  "We recognize that airborne particulate bacteria are a

           21     major source of contamination in the OR environment and that

           22     bacteria shed by personnel are the predominant source of

           23     these particles.  The focus of our"  -- do you want me to

           24     keep going?

           25     Q.  No, I really want to ask you about the justification and




                                                                            516



            1     it says, "air is a potential source of contamination in the

            2     OR," and this is the part that I wanted to focus on.

            3     A.  Okay.

            4     Q.  "Studies have demonstrated that the number of airborne

            5     bacteria around the wound is correlated to the incident of

            6     periprosthetic joint infection."  Can you tell the ladies

            7     and gentlemen of the jury what that means?

            8     A.  So it's the airborne bacteria that is correlated with

            9     the infection in the joint.  It's airborne bacteria that is

           10     affecting the deep joint.  It's not the skin.  It's not the

           11     skin on the patient's skin.  It's the airborne bacteria that

           12     are floating on skin or particles or dust that are then

           13     making their way into the wound and infecting that joint.

           14     Q.  I want to shift gears.  You were asked some questions

           15     about Mr. Gareis having a prior total hip replacement on his

           16     other hip, and he had two other in his revision surgeries.

           17     And the questions were something about him using the Bair

           18     Hugger and not getting the infections in those, and I want

           19     to ask you is that significant to you as an orthopedic

           20     surgeon that he used the Bair Hugger in other instances and

           21     did not get an infection?

           22     A.  It is.  To answer your question, that's not significant

           23     to me.

           24     Q.  Why not?

           25     A.  Because like I said, the operating room is not a robotic




                                                                            517



            1     room.  It's a, it's not a one hundred percent sterile room.

            2     We do everything we can to control the skin cells and the

            3     bacteria getting into the wound.  And it is the Bair Hugger

            4     in Mr. Gareis's case is an example of how statistics don't

            5     say are not often understood in terms of human beings.  In

            6     Mr. Gareis's case, he had a 25 percent incidents of being

            7     infected, which I believe by the Bair Hugger.  That's a

            8     25 percent incident in Mr. Gareis.

            9               But if we do a million joints, and we increase

           10     that rate by one percent, that's ten thousand people.

           11     That's a lot of lives.

           12               MS. PRUITT:  Objection, Your Honor, violation of

           13     MIL5, which you ruled on.  I move to strike.  I think it

           14     might have been 4, Your Honor.  MIL4.

           15               THE COURT:  The motion to strike is denied.

           16     BY MR. FARRAR:

           17     Q.  You were saying, you were saying a one percent increase

           18     in the million?

           19     A.  That's a -- it's just, in the example of Mr. Gareis, the

           20     25 percent incident of infection is Mr. Gareis.  A one

           21     percent increase, I'm just using that as a number.  One

           22     percent of a million joints is ten thousand lives.  So the

           23     reason why I'm saying there is that activity in that

           24     operating room, there is the increased skin cells on the

           25     floor in the air and the particles and the bacteria in the




                                                                            518



            1     floor in the air, but that's not a license to bring in a

            2     device that's going to make it harder for us to control the

            3     environment.  It's like playing Russian roulette.  Of

            4     course, if I play Russian roulette today with a gun and I

            5     don't die, that doesn't mean that I should do it again

            6     tomorrow because eventually I am going to get killed.

            7     Q.  Doesn't make the gun safe?

            8     A.  It does not make the gun safe.

            9     Q.  Makes it unreasonably dangerous?

           10               MS. PRUITT:  Objection, Your Honor.

           11               THE COURT:  Sustained, sustained.

           12     BY MR. FARRAR:

           13     Q.  It's fine.

           14     A.  I will tell you that --

           15               THE COURT:  Okay, wait for a question.

           16               THE WITNESS:  Okay, gotcha.

           17     BY MR. FARRAR:

           18     Q.  Let me ask you the last thing, and I'm going to --

           19               MR. FARRAR:  May I approach, Your Honor?

           20               THE COURT:  You may.

           21     BY MR. FARRAR:

           22     Q.  I'm going to hand you what is Exhibit 1503.  And it is a

           23     summary of the bills for Mr. Gareis.

           24               MR. FARRAR:  Ms. Pruitt, I don't think you have an

           25     objection.




                                                                             519



            1               MS. PRUITT:  I have no objection.

            2               MR. FARRAR:  We're going to move it into evidence.

            3     BY MR. FARRAR:

            4     Q.  Have you had a chance to review the bills for the care

            5     for Mr. Gareis after the surgery to treat the infection?

            6     A.  Yes, sir.

            7     Q.  And did you find them to be reasonable and necessary?

            8     A.  I did.

            9     Q.  And could you tell us what the total was?

           10     A.  $211,218.

           11               MR. FARRAR:  Thank you, Doctor.

           12               THE COURT:  Ms. Pruitt.

           13                         RECROSS EXAMINATION

           14     BY MS. PRUITT:

           15     Q.  Good morning, Dr. Stonnington.

           16     A.  Good morning.

           17     Q.  I believe there's a book up there that Mr. Farrar gave

           18     you yesterday that you used that had plaintiff's exhibits in

           19     it.  Do you recall that?

           20     A.  Yes, ma'am, is this?

           21     Q.  Thank you.  And he asked you about a few of those on

           22     cross-examination for the first time or redirect examination

           23     for the first time, and I want to ask you about a couple of

           24     them.

           25               But first I want to go back to the international




                                                                             520



            1     consensus document, this big document that you have up there

            2     still, correct?

            3     A.  I do, but I think I messed it up.

            4     Q.  If you did, I've got another copy so let me know.  Turn

            5     back to page 116, which is where Mr. Farrar was talking with

            6     you just a moment ago, and it's the answer to question 2,

            7     which is what he wanted you to discuss, and it's 116.

            8     A.  I have it.

            9     Q.  Got it?

           10     A.  Yes, ma'am.

           11     Q.  Okay.  Where it says, "justification," under question 2,

           12     go down to the very last sentence of the justification.  And

           13     I'm reading:  "Movements of personnel and objects including

           14     OR equipment and opening and closing doors can generate

           15     significantly marked air currents and increase the

           16     probability of bacteria being deposited in the surgical

           17     site."  Did I read that correctly?

           18     A.  You did.

           19     Q.  Now, you were also asked for the first time in redirect

           20     about a sponsorship of this consensus by 3M.  Do you recall

           21     that?

           22     A.  Yes, ma'am.

           23     Q.  And you told the jury about 3M being a sponsor, but

           24     there were probably as many as 25 sponsors of this consensus

           25     group, correct?




                                                                             521



            1     A.  I don't know that, ma'am.

            2     Q.  Did you -- well, turn to page 5, 6, 7, and 8, there in

            3     the document you can verify all of the sponsorships for that

            4     meeting.

            5     A.  Typically, at meetings, that means the bigger the

            6     letters, that means the more major the sponsor, so.

            7     Q.  That wasn't my question, Doctor.  My question was there

            8     are three pages of sponsorships for this meeting, correct?

            9     A.  Yes, ma'am.

           10     Q.  And you also read the letter from the organizers where

           11     the sponsors of this meeting agreed not to be a part of the

           12     voting delegation; isn't that correct?

           13     A.  That's correct, but there are people at the meeting who

           14     work for 3M as well.

           15     Q.  And that's a good thing if a company sponsors an

           16     international consensus of doctors all over the world to try

           17     to look at issues involving their products and other

           18     people's products, you would want that to happen, wouldn't

           19     you, sir?

           20     A.  I would.

           21     Q.  Now, let's take a look at another exhibit, well, there's

           22     one other thing I want to ask you about the consensus before

           23     we get off that.

           24               You told the jury yesterday in response to

           25     question number 15 in this consensus document that the




                                                                             522



            1     delegate vote on this question, the finding was, "we

            2     recognize the theoretical risk posed by forced air warming

            3     blankets and that no studies have shown an increase in

            4     surgical site infections related to the use of these

            5     devices.  We recommend further study and no change to

            6     current practice."  That was the consensus conclusion,

            7     correct?

            8     A.  It was, and 11 percent did not go along with it.

            9     Q.  Okay, that's what I want to ask you about.  You told the

           10     jury yesterday that 11 percent didn't go along with it.

           11     It's actually five percent of the people voting did not go

           12     along with it.  You understand that?

           13     A.  Oh, yes, ma'am.  The other group abstained but that

           14     means a total of 11 percent didn't go along with it.

           15     Q.  But the ones abstaining didn't necessarily not go along

           16     with it, Doctor, you're speculating that.  There was five

           17     percent of the people that disagreed, correct?

           18     A.  Ma'am, five percent disagreed, and six percent

           19     abstained, and I'm not speculating.  They abstained, so they

           20     did not go along with it.  The 89 percent --

           21     Q.  And you have no idea why they didn't vote, do you, sir?

           22     A.  No, what's important to me is that 11 percent didn't

           23     jump on board.

           24     Q.  And my question is according to this document, only five

           25     percent disagreed, isn't that right?




                                                                             523



            1     A.  Five percent disagreed, and 11 percent did not jump on

            2     board, and I think that is a significant number given that

            3     that was perhaps four years ago, five years ago.

            4     Q.  Now, if you would turn with me to the Exhibit P700 in

            5     your book that you were asked about in your redirect

            6     yesterday.  And let me know when you're there?

            7     A.  P700 you said?

            8     Q.  Yes, sir.

            9     A.  I've got it.

           10     Q.  And P700 was a study on prosthetic joint infections and

           11     you and Mr. Farrar read a portion of that study to the jury,

           12     do you recall that?

           13     A.  Yes, ma'am.

           14     Q.  Now, I want you go down on page P700-2 and read four

           15     lines or five lines from the bottom.  This is the sentence

           16     directly after what you read to the jury yesterday, and I am

           17     reading beginning with?

           18     A.  Can you direct me to where I --

           19     Q.  Sure.  It is on the second page, the second column on

           20     the right all the way down to the bottom?

           21     A.  Where it starts with "early and delayed"?

           22     Q.  It's under "clinical presentation," and it's the fifth

           23     or sixth line from the bottom.

           24     A.  Okay.

           25     Q.  This is the sentence that was directly after what you




                                                                             524



            1     read to the jury yesterday, and I read:  "The most frequent

            2     sources of bacteremia are skin, respiratory tract, dental,

            3     and urinary tract infections," did I read that sentence

            4     correctly, sir?

            5     A.  Yes, ma'am, but it's taken out of context.

            6     Q.  I wanted to add context because you didn't read that

            7     sentence to the jury, sir.

            8     A.  Well, reading that sentence --

            9     Q.  I'm not going to argue with you.  Did I read it

           10     correctly?

           11     A.  You read it correctly.

           12     Q.  Now, for the first time yesterday on redirect, you told

           13     this jury that you didn't think there were any benefits to

           14     patient warming in orthopedic surgeries; is that correct?

           15     A.  I believe I said that it has not been proven to be of

           16     any benefit in orthopedic surgery.

           17     Q.  Okay.  You were warming patients with the Bair Hugger in

           18     November of 2010 when Mr. Gareis had his procedure, correct?

           19     A.  Yes, ma'am.

           20     Q.  And you're warming patients today not with the Bair

           21     Hugger but with something else.  You're providing warming

           22     for your patients in orthopedic surgeries, correct, sir?

           23     A.  Yes, ma'am, but that's the evolution of what's going on

           24     here.  I'm warming patients because I have to also work with

           25     anesthesiologists.  If I had my say, I would not be warming




                                                                             525



            1     any patients where I'm doing total hips or total knees or

            2     outpatient surgery.

            3     Q.  So your anesthesiologists believe that there's benefits

            4     to warming patients but you don't?

            5     A.  That is an answer that you can't give with a yes or no.

            6     I have to be able to talk and give it in a little bit more

            7     elaborate answer and say yes or no because it's not really a

            8     fair way to ask me that question.

            9     Q.  Well, I'm not trying to be unfair.  I just want the jury

           10     to understand.  Somebody in your hospital, the

           11     anesthesiologists or the hospital or somebody believes that

           12     warming patients in orthopedic surgery is beneficial; is

           13     that correct?

           14     A.  Yes, ma'am, but what, what, what, you all need to

           15     understand is that data is based on colorectal surgery,

           16     which is a dirty surgery.  And I think I believe the author

           17     has even admitted it's a flawed study.  It was in 1996, a

           18     2017 study by Frish, a very large retrospective study showed

           19     no increased complications rates in I think it was over a

           20     couple thousand, I can't remember the exact number, but it

           21     was a lot, of total joints, meaning total hips, total knees

           22     where there was not an increased complication rate, and

           23     there was not an increase infection rate.

           24               So the anesthesia has been taught based on that

           25     study in 1996, and it has not been adequately in my opinion




                                                                             526



            1     debated within the anesthesia community and that's our

            2     fault.  It's anesthesia surgeries fault, it's all our fault.

            3     Q.  Dr. Stonnington, do you remember what my question was?

            4     A.  That's what I'm trying to give the answer --

            5     Q.  What was my question, sir?

            6     A.  The question was whether or not that I believe, that I

            7     believe differently from anesthesia I think it was.

            8     Q.  No, my question was somebody at three institutions where

            9     you perform hip surgeries either the anesthesiologists or

           10     the hospital believe warming patients provides benefits;

           11     isn't that correct?

           12     A.  That's why I answered it like I did because they do

           13     believe it provides benefit.  I believed it's on flawed

           14     data.

           15     Q.  You just think they're all misguided, correct?

           16     A.  I wouldn't.  That's your term, not my term.  I would say

           17     that we have not adequately debated the issue.  And I would

           18     never tell my anesthesiologists that they're misguided.  I

           19     can't do surgeries without them.  They are some of the most

           20     brilliant people I work with, but I believe that we have a

           21     very different assessment of what warming does, and there's

           22     plenty of people that are studying it now that are trying to

           23     really settle this argument.  The fact is I didn't use

           24     warming for three months --

           25     Q.  We've heard that.




                                                                             527



            1     A.  -- and I had no increased complication rates, no

            2     infection rates.

            3               MS. PRUITT:  Your Honor, I'd ask please that's

            4     cumulative.  The jury has already heard it.  Would you

            5     please ask him to move on?

            6               THE COURT:  I think we're about to wrap up here.

            7               MS. PRUITT:  Yes.

            8     BY MS. PRUITT:

            9     Q.  Dr. Stonnington, one other question or two.  I will

           10     never promise one other question because lawyers don't

           11     usually do that.  I can never ask only one question.

           12               When someone, when a patient is put under

           13     anesthesia, the body doesn't know whether it's going to have

           14     a hip surgery or a colorectal surgery; does it, sir?

           15     A.  I'm not sure I understand your question.

           16     Q.  When you put somebody to sleep, they don't know whether

           17     they're having a hip replacement or a colon surgery; do

           18     they, sir?

           19     A.  They have been told what surgery they're going to have

           20     before the surgery.

           21     Q.  Okay.  The anesthetic, the way it physiologically

           22     effects the patient is the same regardless of what type of

           23     surgery they're having; would you agree with that,

           24     Dr. Stonnington?

           25     A.  It's not the anesthetic that affects the infection rate.




                                                                            528



            1     I'm not sure what you're asking me, but it's not the

            2     anesthetic that affects the infection rate.

            3     Q.  We will ask an anesthesiologist what the effects of

            4     anesthesia are.  I'm not going to argue with you.  Thank you

            5     so much.

            6               THE COURT:  All right.  Anything else, Mr. Farrar?

            7               MR. FARRAR:   Nothing further, Your Honor.

            8               THE COURT:  All right.  Oh, you said nothing

            9     further?

           10               MR. FARRAR:   Nothing further, Your Honor.

           11               THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.  You may step

           12     down.  Call your next witness.

           13               MR. FARRAR:  Could Dr. Stonnington be released?

           14               THE COURT:  Yes.

           15               MS. CONLIN:  For our next witness, Your Honor,

           16     plaintiffs call to the stand Dr. Andrea Kurz, who is a

           17     physician at Cleveland Clinic.

           18               THE COURT:  All right.  Call Dr. Kurz.

           19               MS. CONLIN:  By video deposition, Your Honor.

           20               THE COURT:  Okay.

           21               VIDEO DEPOSITION OF DR. ANDREA KURZ AS FOLLOWS:

           22     Q.  Let us begin by if you could just state your full name

           23     for the record?

           24     A.  Andrea Kurz.

           25     Q.  So, Doctor, can you just briefly describe your




                                                                            529



            1     background starting off what's your educational background

            2     going with college to medical school residency?

            3     A.  So I went, I grew up in Vienna, Austria, so I actually

            4     didn't go to college because we don't have that there.

            5     After high school or gymnasium, I did medical school in

            6     Vienna.  Thereafter, I did research fellowship in, actually

            7     after med school I started residency in Vienna.  In the

            8     fourth or fifth year of residency, I started a research

            9     fellowship at the University of San Francisco, of California

           10     in San Francisco.

           11     Q.  What year was that, the research fellowship?  You can

           12     look at your CV?

           13     A.  I should know that.  It started from '93 to '96.

           14     Q.  So you were actually in San Francisco at that time?

           15     A.  Yes.

           16     Q.  I don't mean to interrupt.  I'll try not to do that in

           17     the future, but according to your CV, it says your education

           18     University of Vienna, 1990 to 1994.

           19     A.  Yeah. That overlaps.

           20     Q.  Overlaps.  Okay.  Continue.

           21     A.  So thereafter, I went back to Vienna, got my

           22     professorship there.  Then --

           23     Q.  What year was that?

           24     A.  '96.  Then in '98 or '99, I have to look it up almost, I

           25     went to Washington University in St. Louis as a director of




                                                                            530



            1     the division of clinical research there.  Thereafter, was

            2     recruited in 2004 or '3 as the chair of the Department of

            3     Anesthesia at the University of Bern in Switzerland.  And

            4     now I don't know when it was exactly, but I think it was '3,

            5     end of '3, beginning of '4.  And in 2007, left Switzerland

            6     and joined the Department of Outcomes Research here at the

            7     Cleveland Clinic.

            8     Q.  So since 2007, you've been here at the Cleveland Clinic?

            9     A.  Yes, and I was vice chair of the Department of Outcomes

           10     Research, and in 2014, I became chair of the Department of

           11     General Anesthesia, within the Anesthesia Institute here.

           12     Q.  So 2014, you became chair of general anesthesia?

           13     A.  General anesthesia here.

           14     Q.  That's not part of Outcomes Research, correct?

           15     A.  It's not part of Outcomes Research, no.

           16     Q.  Do you have a clinical practice right now?

           17     A.  Yes, absolutely.

           18     Q.  What percentage of your time are you dealing with your

           19     clinical practice as compared to dealing with your work at

           20     Outcomes Research?

           21     A.  My clinical practice is 50 percent, the rest is

           22     administration and part of that is research, and that's when

           23     I, when collaborate with Outcomes Research.  So I can't give

           24     you a percentage exactly.

           25     Q.  With respect to your clinical practice, can you describe




                                                                            531



            1     your clinical practice?

            2     A.  I work in the operating rooms and anesthetize patients

            3     50 percent of my time.  When I do that, I usually either

            4     supervise residents or nurse anesthetists.  And that's

            5     pretty much it I think.

            6     Q.  Are you in a certain, do you handle more than like one

            7     type of surgery or the other?

            8     A.  Mainly, urology but otherwise everything.

            9     Q.  When you say mainly urology, what percentage of your

           10     clinical practice is dealing with anesthesia patients in

           11     urology?

           12     A.  Approximately 60 percent.

           13     Q.  Do you handle any anesthesia services for orthopedic

           14     patients?

           15     A.  I work there, yes.  Very little.

           16     Q.  Now would that include total hip and total knee

           17     arthroplasty?

           18     A.  Yes.

           19     Q.  And with respect to the year 1996 New England Journal,

           20     I'm going to call it the Kurz study of 1996?

           21     A.  That's totally fine.

           22     Q.  What?

           23     A.  That is fine.

           24     Q.  In your 1996 Kurz study, were you the lead researcher?

           25     A.  Uh-huh.




                                                                            532



            1     Q.  Yes?

            2     A.  Yes.

            3     Q.  Okay.  What role did Dr. Sessler have in the 1996 Kurz

            4     study?

            5     A.  He was the senior researcher, so he was my mentor.

            6     Q.  Well, before we get there, do you currently consult for

            7     3M?

            8     A.  Yes.

            9     Q.  How long have you consulted for 3M?

           10     A.  I don't know exactly.  Three, four years, five years.

           11     Q.  Who else did you do consulting services for or on the

           12     advisory panel for?

           13     A.  Currently, only one other company that is here in

           14     Cleveland.

           15     Q.  Mercury biomed?

           16     A.  Yes.

           17     Q.  And you have no expertise in orthopedic surgery,

           18     correct?

           19     A.  No.

           20     Q.  Do you have any expertise in periprosthetic joint

           21     infections?

           22     A.  No.

           23     Q.  Do you have any expertise with respect to the causation

           24     of periprosthetic joint infections is?

           25     A.  No.




                                                                            533



            1     Q.  Do you have an understanding that periprosthetic joint

            2     infections are different than a soft tissue wound infection?

            3     A.  Yes.

            4     Q.  And sitting here today you have done no studies with

            5     respect to normothermia and the incidents of periprosthetic

            6     joint infection?

            7     A.  That's correct.

            8     Q.  And sitting here today, you're aware of no studies

            9     conducted by you yourself or anyone in the field with

           10     respect to normothermia and incidents of infection in

           11     orthopedic surgeries?

           12     A.  I don't know studies about that, yes.

           13     Q.  Okay.  Well you, you're an expert in the field of

           14     normothermia, correct?

           15     A.  Yes.

           16     Q.  And many of the studies are conducted probably like

           17     through Outcomes Research with respect to normothermia?

           18     A.  That is correct.

           19     Q.  And if a study comes out that is a significant study,

           20     you keep yourself apprised of the research that's being done

           21     and the publications in the field of normothermia, correct?

           22     A.  Mostly, Yes.

           23     Q.  What degree celsius is considered hypothermia, below

           24     what number?

           25     A.  I would say everything below the normal core




                                                                            534



            1     temperature.

            2     Q.  Which is?

            3     A.  Whatever you come in with, 36.7, maybe for you 36.8.

            4     For me, whichever is your pre-operative core temperature.

            5     Q.  And my understanding is that at 34.5, the body

            6     vasoconstricts and usually remains at 34.5 degrees, correct?

            7     A.  Simply said, yes.

            8     Q.  Are there any parts of the operating room that are

            9     considered sterile such as a sterile field?

           10     A.  Yes.

           11     Q.  And would you agree with me that the goal of the

           12     operating personnel is to keep the sterile field as sterile

           13     as possible?

           14     A.  Yes.

           15     Q.  Okay.  As a result, you, surgeons try to keep their

           16     hands above the operating room table at all times, correct?

           17     A.  I assume.

           18     Q.  Okay.  So right now the only article that looked at

           19     intraoperative warming and infection rates is your 1996 Kurz

           20     article, correct?

           21     A.  Give me one second.  Yes, correct.

           22     Q.  My question, from my last question, correct?

           23     A.  Yes.

           24     Q.  What's been marked as Exhibit 242 is an article in the

           25     New England Journal of Medicine titled perioperative,




                                                                            535



            1     "Perioperative Normothermia to Reduce the Incidents of

            2     Surgical Wound Infection and Shorten Hospitalization," dated

            3     May 9, 1996, in which you're the first author?

            4     A.  Yeah.

            5     Q.  Are you familiar with this article, correct?

            6     A.  Yes.

            7     Q.  Who created the protocols for this study?

            8     A.  That was Dan Sessler and me.

            9     Q.  And this is when you were a fellow, correct?

           10     A.  Exactly.

           11     Q.  Who did the majority of the analysis?

           12     A.  That was also Dan and me.

           13     Q.  Okay.  If you looked at the first paragraph, you know

           14     where it starts with "Wound," about two-thirds of the way

           15     down it says, "Mild perioperative hypothermia approximately

           16     two degrees celsius below normal core body temperature is

           17     common in colon surgery."

           18     A.  Yes.

           19     Q.  If you told me before that mild hypothermia was 35.5

           20     degree celsius, but if normal core body temperature is about

           21     36.5, why is mild hypothermia in this case two degrees

           22     celsius below instead of one?

           23     A.  I guess we just saw that differently more than 20 years

           24     ago because what is mild, what's considered mild now, was

           25     20 years ago when nobody was warmed in the OR, somewhat




                                                                            536



            1     different.

            2     Q.  Okay.

            3     A.  So a core temperature of 34 was something we saw every

            4     day then, so wasn't a big deal.  If we would see it today,

            5     we would say it's severe hypothermia.

            6     Q.  Did you see core temperatures of 34 a lot back then or

            7     was it --

            8     A.  Yes.

            9     Q.  34.5, 30 --

           10     A.  It was rare below.  It went down to 33 but 34, 34.5 were

           11     very common.

           12     Q.  Okay.  So over time that has changed?

           13     A.  Absolutely.

           14     Q.  Now, it's my understanding that in this study you had

           15     two groups, a control group and a group that was warmed with

           16     a Bair Hugger unit, correct?

           17     A.  Yes, that's correct.

           18     Q.  And initially you were looking to do this for 400

           19     patients, but after 200 patients you had enough data to get

           20     a P value that showed statistical significance so you ended

           21     the study, correct?

           22     A.  Yes.

           23     Q.  In your study, you decided to use the Bair Hugger on for

           24     both patients, just had the heating level at a different --

           25     one was ambient and one was heat, correct?




                                                                            537



            1     A.  Yes.

            2     Q.  Why for the control, which you decided to use the

            3     ambient temperature, which takes basically operating room

            4     temperature and pushes it over the patient instead of just

            5     keeping the Bair Hugger off?

            6     A.  We deemed that -- you could have done that just as well,

            7     but we deemed that the cleaner study design, because our

            8     outcome was in many ways also dependent on surgeons, and we

            9     wanted to be -- the surgeons -- to have the surgeons and

           10     everybody in the OR blinded.

           11     Q.  So you think when you're anesthetized, the cooling

           12     effect of blowing air is different than when you're not

           13     anesthetized.

           14     A.  Absolutely.

           15     Q.  Oh, okay.  So you don't think the cooling air that's

           16     running over your body is going to take the moisture and

           17     bring any type of warmth that's coming from your body away

           18     from your body?

           19     A.  That's not what I said.  When you say now is correct.

           20     Q.  So you're saying that the Bair Hugger blowing at ambient

           21     temperatures can have a cooling effect on a patient?

           22     A.  It could have, yes, depending on the ambient

           23     temperature.

           24     Q.  Well, what's the ambient temperature of an operating

           25     room?




                                                                            538



            1     A.  It's in the paper, I assume.  It should be in Table 1.

            2     Q.  Okay.

            3     A.  Or somewhere I hope.

            4     Q.  21.9 degrees or 22.1, depending on the control group,

            5     correct?

            6     A.  So 22 will not have a large cooling effect.

            7     Q.  Do you recall sending an e-mail or having a KOL meeting

            8     with 3M down in Washington, DC, and sending an e-mail that

            9     the hypothermia -- the rates that were used back then is

           10     something we rarely see nowadays of 30 --

           11     A.  Yes.

           12     Q.  Okay.  What did you mean by that email, do you recall

           13     stating that?

           14     A.  Oh, it's very simple.  That was based on our

           15     retrospective study which only included patients that were

           16     warmed.

           17     Q.  By which method, passive warming?

           18     A.  No.  All forced air warming.

           19     Q.  And with respect to -- strike that.

           20               These are surgeries that lasted three hours,

           21     correct?

           22     A.  Yes.

           23     Q.  So this is three hours of no warming, correct?

           24     A.  Yes.

           25     Q.  And three hours of air -- Bair Hugger being on blowing




                                                                            539



            1     ambient air over the patient, correct?

            2     A.  Not correct.  It's three hours of active warming with

            3     the Bair Hugger at 42 degrees or three hours of having the

            4     Bair Hugger's control with ambient warming.

            5     Q.  Which is just ambient air?

            6     A.  Right.

            7     Q.  Which is at 22 degrees?

            8     A.  Right.

            9     Q.  Under the discussion period, discussion section, you

           10     write, "the initial hours after bacterial contamination are

           11     a decisive period for the establishment of infection."  Did

           12     I read that correctly?

           13     A.  You, absolutely.

           14     Q.  What do you mean by that?

           15     A.  That a big -- that an infection in a patient is usually

           16     established during the initial hours of surgery, so it's not

           17     that it happens five days after surgery.  It pretty much

           18     happens right away, and it's exactly why we give antibiotics

           19     before surgery or right before surgery and not just in the

           20     middle or whenever we think of it.

           21     Q.  So you're saying the -- the contamination occurs during

           22     the perioperative period?

           23     A.  Yes.

           24     Q.  Okay.  Does that go for all surgeries or just

           25     colorectal?




                                                                            540



            1     A.  It's different for different surgeries and patient

            2     population.

            3     Q.  All right.  And then about the next paragraph you write

            4     on the second sentence, "perioperative hypothermia persisted

            5     for more than four hours and thus included the decisive

            6     period for establishing an infection"?

            7     A.  Correct.

            8     Q.  I'm trying to understand this.  Are you saying that you

            9     are more susceptible for an infection when you're

           10     hypothermic as compared to when you're not hypothermic?

           11     A.  To a certain degree, yes.

           12     Q.  Okay.

           13     A.  Actually, it's exactly what I'm saying.

           14     Q.  Okay.  And if I understand you correctly, you're saying

           15     because the hypothermia lasted for four hours because the

           16     surgery was three hours plus, that that established enough

           17     time for the host defense system to become weakened and,

           18     therefore, unable to fight off a bacteria combination --

           19     contamination increasing the risk of surgery?

           20     A.  Yes, that's part of it.

           21     Q.  What's the other part?

           22     A.  The other part is that hypothermia causes

           23     vasoconstriction, which decreases perfusion to the wound

           24     and, therefore, nutrients, important nutrients, oxygen and

           25     other things that the wound needs for healing, is not




                                                                            541



            1     getting there.

            2     Q.  At what point, does hypothermia vasoconstriction?

            3     A.  That depends on the patient's demographic, the

            4     anesthetic used, the dose of the anesthetic used, so there

            5     are various different factors.

            6     Q.  So but if you took best case scenario, like what's the

            7     highest degree you saw of vasoconstriction below the core

            8     temperature?

            9     A.  With a low dose of anesthetic, you can get core -- vaso-

           10     constriction within a degree.

           11     Q.  One degree?

           12     A.  Yes.

           13     Q.  Okay.

           14     A.  With usually used doses, you probably tend to go two

           15     degrees.

           16     Q.  Two degrees.  Is that a yes?

           17     A.  Yes.

           18     Q.  Okay.  So if a patient is like at 35 degrees, can you

           19     sit here and tell me today what is the risk, relative risk

           20     factor of that patient getting an infection?

           21     A.  No.

           22     Q.  Would you agree with me that out of two hundred

           23     patients, the ones that got infection, they were mostly

           24     superficial infections with few clinical consequences?

           25     A.  I would agree with that, yes.




                                                                            542



            1     Q.  And would you agree with me today that if you looked at

            2     what was considered hypothermia today with colorectal

            3     surgery, you're expecting, instead of a threefold reduction

            4     in infections, about 30 percent?  That would be your

            5     hypothesis?

            6     A.  Yeah, it might be.

            7     Q.  Well, let me go back.  Let me just explain what this

            8     document is. This document was produced by 3M.  If you look

            9     at the first page it's dated October 18, 2012, Global

           10     Patient Warming Advisory Board Meeting, and it's the minutes

           11     of that meeting.  And you're listed as you and Daniel

           12     Sessler and a bunch of other people are listed at that

           13     meeting.  Do you recall being at that meeting?

           14     A.  Yes, I do.

           15     Q.  Do you recall discussing the Troponin study proposal?

           16     A.  I do.

           17     Q.  Okay.  If you look back on the page, it says, "Kurz 1996

           18     SSI paper limitations:  Only 200 patients, mostly

           19     superficial infections with a few clinical consequences (we

           20     should focus on deep tissue/organ SSIs)..."

           21               Did I read that correctly?

           22     A.  Yes, you do.

           23     Q.  It says, "the factor of 3 risk increase is not plausible

           24     (30 or so is more -- is more likely)."

           25     A.  Yes.




                                                                            543



            1     Q.  Do you agree with that statement?

            2     A.  Absolutely.

            3     Q.  So sitting here today, there is no evidence for you to

            4     offer the opinion that maintaining normothermia reduces the

            5     incidents of deep tissue infection?

            6     A.  I wouldn't phrase it that way.

            7     Q.  Is there any evidence of any research that you've done

            8     or read that indicates that maintaining normothermia reduces

            9     the incidents of a deep tissue infection?

           10     A.  I doubt there is.

           11     Q.  Okay.

           12     A.  But I don't know.

           13     Q.  Well, for example, let's take a surgery of two hours.

           14     Not a colorectal but a two hour surgery.  What do you

           15     usually see for degree hours on a --

           16     A.  Nowadays?

           17     Q.  Yeah.

           18     A.  One degree.  Time -- I'm not sure what the time weighted

           19     average would be.  Not much.

           20     Q.  Probably?

           21     A.  Not much.

           22     Q.  It wouldn't increase the length of stay or transfusion

           23     rates.  I mean it wouldn't increase the transfusion rates?

           24     A.  Nowadays, I don't think so.

           25     Q.  And is there any research with respect to the incidents




                                                                            544



            1     of infection with respect to surgeries that last one hour or

            2     less?

            3     A.  I don't know of any.

            4     Q.  What about two hours or less?

            5     A.  I don't know of that either.

            6     Q.  Okay.

            7     A.  There is very little research in that regards,

            8     especially prospective research.  There might be one or the

            9     other retrospective study.

           10     Q.  Dr. Kurz, what's been marked as Exhibit 245 is an

           11     article titled, Compliance With Surgical (SCIP Inf-10) is

           12     Associated with Improved Clinical Conditions.  Are you

           13     familiar with this document?

           14               MR. GORDON:  It's outcomes not conditions.

           15               MR. ASSAAD:  Outcomes, correct.

           16               THE WITNESS:  Yes, I am.

           17     Q.  Have you looked at the data in this document?

           18     A.  Yes, I did.

           19     Q.  Okay.  And if you look at Table 4, and I want to focus

           20     on wound infections, because that was mainly what the

           21     infections that were discovered during the 1996 Kurz study,

           22     correct?

           23     A.  Yes.

           24     Q.  You agree with me that there's no statistically

           25     significant difference between SCIP compliance and SCIP




                                                                            545



            1     non-compliance?

            2     A.  Yes.

            3     Q.  So what this retrospective study is telling me that in

            4     general there's no statistical difference in wound

            5     infections between patients that are SCIP compliant, which

            6     is either active warming or they maintain normothermia and

            7     SCIP noncompliant, is that correct?

            8     A.  I assume it is.

            9     Q.  Okay.  And you have no reason to disagree with these

           10     numbers, correct?

           11     A.  Other than that they're very small, no.

           12     Q.  For wound infection, I mean this 43,000 patients?

           13     A.  Right, but 44 SCIP noncompliant wound infections.

           14     Q.  Yeah, 44 out of 44,000?

           15     A.  44 out of 1200.

           16     Q.  Where do you get 1200?

           17     A.  In the same --

           18     Q.  Oh, okay.

           19     A.  So it's -- anyway --

           20     Q.  Okay.

           21     A.  I believe the data, but it has problems.

           22     Q.  Okay.  Table 3 talks about SCIP compliant and SCIP

           23     noncompliant.  And for SCIP noncompliant means that you're

           24     not above 36 degrees, and you received no activity warming,

           25     correct?




                                                                            546



            1     A.  And/or, yes.

            2     Q.  Okay.  So there's no active warming, and you do not

            3     leave the operating room at 36 degrees, according to the

            4     criteria or within 15-minutes --

            5     A.  Right.

            6     Q.  Okay.  And for those patients, we're seeing an end

            7     operating room temperature, core temperature of

            8     35.1 degrees?

            9     A.  Yeah.

           10     Q.  Okay.  You agree with me sitting here today that there's

           11     no evidence that a one degree change of temperature in the

           12     core body temperature has any effect on infection rates?

           13     A.  I agree that there's very little evidence for that, yes.

           14     Q.  Okay.  So sitting here today, you don't know if one

           15     degree of hypothermia has any effect on infection rates?

           16     A.  Yes.

           17     Q.  Okay.  And Dr. Sessler has mentioned in an e-mail before

           18     in today's standards and with respect to reliability of

           19     studies, that he probably wouldn't have published the 1996

           20     Kurz paper, do you agree with him?

           21     A.  Absolutely.

           22     Q.  Okay.

           23     A.  I would not have either.

           24     Q.  So without that paper meeting today's standards, do you

           25     agree with me that there's no scientific evidence today that




                                                                            547



            1     active warming or maintaining normothermia reduces the

            2     incidents of infection?

            3     A.  If -- I mean if you exclude the only paper that shows

            4     that, then there is no evidence.

            5     Q.  Well, we discussed later there's only one paper

            6     regarding the infection rates, correct?

            7     A.  You could -- you have a second one which you excluded,

            8     the Melling paper.

            9     Q.  Well, you couldn't tell me whether or not that was

           10     intraoperative warming, correct?

           11     A.  It doesn't matter.

           12     Q.  Okay.

           13     A.  It does not matter.  We are talking about maintenance of

           14     normothermia --

           15     Q.  Okay.

           16     A.  Whether you you warm the patients.

           17     Q.  Do you think Melling was a good study?

           18     A.  It was an okay study for the time.

           19     Q.  Would you agree with me that that wouldn't be published

           20     today?

           21     A.  I absolutely would agree with you.

           22     Q.  Okay.  So sitting here today, what paper that could --

           23     that -- what evidence that could be published today supports

           24     active warming in the active warming and normothermia that

           25     reduces the incidents of infection?




                                                                            548



            1     A.  Very little.

            2     Q.  None, correct?

            3     A.  I'm not quite sure.  I'm still -- I'm still debating

            4     about blood loss and other studies.

            5     Q.  Talking about infection.

            6     A.  Yeah.

            7     Q.  In today's scientific standards, there is no reliable

            8     evidence that supports that maintaining normothermia reduces

            9     the incidents of infection.

           10     A.  That is correct.

           11     Q.  Back in 2012, you notified 3M that at the KOL meeting in

           12     Washington, that the evidence for hypothermia related

           13     complications mostly does not meet current research

           14     guidelines for reliability and that previous studies were

           15     done with much larger temperature differences than are

           16     currently allowed.  Do you recall saying that to 3M?

           17     A.  That is correct.

           18     Q.  And are you aware since that time 3M has continued to

           19     cite your paper for its marketing purposes with respect to

           20     its claim that forced air warming is a way to maintain

           21     normothermia, which reduces the incidents of infection?

           22     A.  I agree with that.

           23     Q.  You agree that you're aware that they continue their

           24     marketing?

           25     A.  Yes, and I agree that they do that.  I do the same.




                                                                            549



            1     Q.  Okay.  Do you agree that in some surgeries, passive

            2     warming could be as effective as active warming?

            3     A.  I agree that in some surgeries active warming is not

            4     needed and therefore passive warming is sufficient.

            5     Q.  What surgeries would they be?  Can you give me some

            6     examination?

            7     A.  Yeah, your eye.

            8     Q.  What about surgeries lasting less than an hour?

            9     A.  I -- with current knowledge, I probably would agree that

           10     active warming might not be needed.

           11     Q.  Dr. Kurz, I'm Corey Gordon, I represent 3M.  I'm going

           12     to start asking you some followup questions on Exhibit 245.

           13     That's the Scott paper?

           14     A.  Uh-huh.

           15     Q.  Skip Inf-10.

           16     A.  Skip, yeah.  Where did I put that?

           17     Q.  It's right there.  I'm -- I want to clarify because I'm

           18     not sure I heard you correctly.  Are you -- is it your

           19     testimony that there is no evidence today to support the

           20     notion that maintenance of normothermia reduces infections,

           21     any kind of infections?

           22     A.  I think I can't -- it's difficult.  I don't know why you

           23     -- why we talk about it in regards to this.  I mean there

           24     are published papers that show that under certain conditions

           25     there is an effect of maintaining normothermia.




                                                                            550



            1     Q.  A beneficial effect?

            2     A.  It causes a beneficial effect.

            3     Q.  Let me be specific on -- because it was in the context

            4     of the Scott paper that this arose.  If you look at the,

            5     just the front page, the results, they say sort of in the

            6     middle, SCIP compliance was associated with a reduced

            7     incidents of hospital acquired infections and then they go

            8     on to give the number and the odds ratio.  Would you

            9     consider the Scott paper evidence that maintenance of

           10     normothermia has a beneficial impact in terms of reducing

           11     the incidents of hospital acquired infection?

           12     A.  I do.  I do.  And that's what I actually wanted to get

           13     to.  I mean only that this is a very retrospective study.

           14     Wound infections are very, very poorly coded.  However, they

           15     did have things like sepsis and other really, really

           16     important infectious outcomes that were reduced.  So in the

           17     end, I don't care which type of infection it is -- it's

           18     clear there is a positive effect of a decreased infection

           19     incidents in patients that were SCIP compliant.

           20     Q.  And by SCIP compliant, that means maintenance of

           21     normothermia?

           22     A.  Either greater than 36 and/or warmed intraoperatively.

           23     Q.  Okay.  And on page 5, understand discussion, they say

           24     that the primary findings in this study was that SCIP Inf10

           25     compliance was associated with a reduced risk for hospital,




                                                                            551



            1     acquired infections ischemic cardiovascular events, and

            2     mortality as well as a decreased length of stay.  Based

            3     on --

            4     A.  That's the first paragraph of the discussion is it?

            5     Yes.

            6     Q.  First line of the discussion.

            7     A.  Yeah.

            8     Q.  And do you agree disagree with any of those conclusions?

            9     A.  No, I don't.

           10     Q.  And based on the state of evidence today in January of

           11     2017, do you think there's any -- do you think this is an

           12     outlier or do you think this is consistent with the existing

           13     body of medical literature including all your work?

           14     A.  That's the most recent body.  It's clearly consistent

           15     what we did many years ago.  It's under different conditions

           16     but that's the body of literature we have at the moment.

           17     Q.  And in a little bit further on they go on to say our

           18     findings also support those of the original randomized

           19     clinical trials by Kurz, et al., and Frank, et al, on which

           20     this SCIP measure was based?

           21     A.  Right.

           22     Q.  Okay.  So do you consider the Scott study or the Scott

           23     paper to somehow call into question your original paper, the

           24     1996 paper?

           25     A.  I don't, despite the fact that the -- the strict wound




                                                                            552



            1     infections don't seem to be different, but I'm not taking it

            2     so seriously because those are usually very hard to

            3     evaluate.  So I absolutely agree with that paper.

            4     Q.  And on -- with respect to that, I think they -- I'd like

            5     to direct your attention to page 6.

            6     A.  Just one further, yeah.

            7     Q.  On the bottom of the first full paragraph, they say we

            8     also had a lower risk population for wound infection

            9     compared with the randomized trial by Kurz, et al., where

           10     all patients had colorectal surgery.  This may explain why

           11     in our study the composite infection outcome was

           12     significantly increased but wound infection by itself was

           13     not?

           14     A.  Yeah, and I think this was what we said before there

           15     were very few wound infections, real wound infections in

           16     this particular study.

           17     Q.  And in this particular study, there were only a total of

           18     46 orthopedic procedures that were SCIP noncompliant, right?

           19     A.  Yeah.

           20     Q.  And the overall rate of infection in orthopedics tends

           21     to be one percent or less, right?

           22     A.  I would say less than one percent.

           23     Q.  Even if you assume it's one percent with a population of

           24     46 procedures, you wouldn't expect --

           25     A.  I would be --




                                                                            553



            1     Q.  -- even to get one infection?

            2     A.  Exactly, yeah.

            3     Q.  Would you consider this study evidence that maintenance

            4     of normothermia confirms no benefit in orthopedic surgery in

            5     terms of reducing the risk of infection?

            6     A.  I think in regards to orthopedic surgery and wound

            7     infection, these patients, this study cannot make any

            8     statements.

            9     Q.  Okay.  And have you done any research to try and find if

           10     there are any, you know, studies or papers out there now

           11     that address the impact of normothermia on surgical site

           12     infections in orthopedics?

           13     A.  No.

           14     Q.  Okay.  So your 1996 study --

           15     A.  Yes.

           16     Q.  You said it wouldn't, you wouldn't it considered it

           17     publishable today.  What are the reasons for that?

           18     A.  Did -- I really say that I wouldn't consider it

           19     publishable?  I don't think I said it in those words.

           20     Q.  Well, don't let me put words in your mouth.

           21     A.  I think it might not be publishable as well as we did it

           22     25-20 years ago.  So that 1996 study was the first

           23     anesthesia outcome study in patients ever, and I think

           24     that's why it was published so well.  It probably is -- what

           25     we see more in more now in medical research is that numbers




                                                                            554



            1     truly matter.  So you do get some degree of false or by

            2     chance results if you don't study very, very large numbers.

            3     At the point in time, this was the largest anesthesia study

            4     ever.  Nowadays, we consider studies that are five thousand,

            5     ten thousand, twenty thousand patients, the appropriate

            6     size.  So you can see, so, I think you could still publish

            7     it nowadays, but I guess the approach to patient populations

            8     and how large studies are have significantly changed over

            9     the past 20 years.

           10     Q.  So if you were to re-do the study, the 1996 study today,

           11     you would increase the patient population?

           12     A.  Yes.

           13     Q.  Is that right?

           14     A.  Yes.  I couldn't redo the exact study, the exact study,

           15     no.

           16     Q.  Please explain to the jury why you couldn't redo the

           17     study today?

           18     A.  Because it would be considered unethical nowadays not to

           19     warm a patient at all intraoperatively.

           20     Q.  Fine.

           21     A.  No ethics committee, it's become -- over the past

           22     20 years, active warming has become standard of care and

           23     with no study you can deviate from the standard of care.  So

           24     20 years ago, having a control group that wasn't actively

           25     warmed was perfectly fine because nobody else in the world




                                                                            555



            1     warmed patients.  Nowadays, it wouldn't.

            2               The other thing is, of course, and that's one

            3     reason why we are looking at much larger patient

            4     populations.  Due to the fact the patients are warmed, we

            5     don't see the significant decrease of hypothermia anymore

            6     and, therefore, in any study, the effect size wouldn't be as

            7     large as in this particular one.

            8     Q.  I under -- putting aside the ethical, your constraint

            9     that would prevent you from doing a study without warming --

           10     A.  Uh-huh.

           11     Q.  If you were to replicate the study today with a larger

           12     patient population, do you believe that it would show no

           13     impact of warming on infection rates?

           14     A.  I think if I would replicate this study, I would see a

           15     significant effect, an improvement in infection rate, maybe

           16     not the same effect size.

           17     Q.  And earlier I think there were some questions about some

           18     comments that had been made about either by you or

           19     Dr. Sessler that maybe the effect size would be only

           20     30 percent.  Do you recall those?

           21     A.  Yes, I do recall that.

           22     Q.  And I understand that's just your best judgment --

           23     A.  Yes.

           24     Q.  -- based on your expertise and experience, but I want to

           25     make it clear you're not saying or are you saying that the




                                                                            556



            1     evidence today no longer supports the idea that maintenance

            2     of normothermia reduces the risk of surgical site infection?

            3     A.  I think if I understand you correctly, I'm not saying

            4     that.  I am saying that I still believe that maintenance of

            5     normothermia decreases infection risk, but the effect size

            6     might be closer to 30 percent reduction or so, which in

            7     effect is a humongous, enormously large effect size for any

            8     medical intervention.

            9     Q.  Do you have any safety concerns about forced air

           10     warming?

           11     A.  No.

           12     Q.  Way earlier, according to my notes, you were asked some

           13     questions about things in the operating room that blow air

           14     directly onto patients.

           15     A.  Yes.

           16     Q.  Do you remember that line of questions?

           17     A.  Yes.

           18     Q.  Does the Bair Hugger blanket blow air directly onto the

           19     surgical site?

           20     A.  The way how we put it on, I don't believe because we

           21     actually -- we put our Bair Huggers on after the patient is

           22     draped.  And so let's say, for example, you have an upper

           23     body cover, you have it taped right here across the

           24     patient's chest and then you have all the OR drapes above

           25     it, which themselves are glued more or less to -- I don't




                                                                            557



            1     know the right term anymore -- to the skin.  So I'm not much

            2     worried about air blowing getting out in that direction.

           16                         DIRECT EXAMINATION

           17     BY MS. CONLIN:

           18     Q.  Good afternoon, Dr. Jarvis.  Could you introduce

           19     yourself to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury?

           20     A.  Hello.  Good afternoon, I think.  I'm William R. Jarvis,

           21     president of Jason and Jarvis Associates.

           22     Q.  And where do you live?

           23     A.  I live in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina.

           24     Q.  And, Doctor, how would you describe your field of

           25     specialty?




                                                                            558



            1     A.  I am an expert in the area of infection control and

            2     hospital epidemiology.  So it kind of covers a wide range of

            3     activities, so although I'm trained initially as a

            4     pediatrician and pediatric infectious diseases, my career

            5     has really been doing clinical pediatric infectious disease

            6     but being trained in hospital epidemiology and infection

            7     control, which covers both neonatology, pediatrics, internal

            8     medicine, surgery, geriatrics, nursing homes and the

            9     infections that can occur associated with exposures in all

           10     of those types of settings regardless of the patient

           11     population.

           12     Q.  And how does that differ, Doctor, from somebody who

           13     would be, for example, like a infectious disease specialist

           14     or board certified infectious disease specialist?

           15     A.  Well, most of the time when I'm doing clinical

           16     infectious diseases, I'm seeing one patient at a time

           17     similar to the infectious disease physician seeing

           18     Mr. Gareis and recommending tests to make a diagnosis and

           19     then recommending therapies.  So as a clinician I would be

           20     doing that, whereas in hospital epidemiology and infection

           21     control, I'm much broader.  I'm looking at populations of

           22     patients, for instance, that would undergo a prosthetic

           23     joint procedure and what are the risk factors for infection

           24     and how do you prevent those infections from occurring.

           25     Q.  Okay.  And could you describe briefly your educational




                                                                            559



            1     background?

            2     A.  I received a BS in psychology from the University of

            3     California at Davis.  And then I went to medical school at

            4     the University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston.

            5     Q.  What did you do after you finished your medical

            6     education?

            7     A.  I initially did a pediatric internship in Houston and

            8     then did two years of pediatric residency at Children's

            9     Hospital in Los Angeles, then I did two infectious disease

           10     fellowships.

           11     Q.  Let me stop you there, what is an infectious disease

           12     fellowship?

           13     A.  It's similar to Dr. Stonnington where it focused on

           14     orthopedics in his residency training.  I focused after my

           15     residency training on a fellowship on infectious diseases.

           16     Q.  Okay.  And I'm sorry I didn't mean to interrupt, you

           17     said you do two of those, where did you do those

           18     fellowships?

           19     A.  Did two infectious disease fellow -- pediatric

           20     infectious disease fellowships.  The first one was at a

           21     Hospital For Sick Children in Toronto, Canada, which was

           22     solely a clinical and microbiology fellowship, and then I

           23     went to Yale University School of Medicine where I did a

           24     combination of pediatric infectious disease fellowship,

           25     epidemiology at the school of public health, and basic




                                                                            560



            1     science biology research.

            2     Q.  We've heard the term "epidemiology," what does that

            3     mean?

            4     A.  In contrast to clinical medicine where you focus on one

            5     patient at a time, diagnosing and treating, epidemiology

            6     looks at populations.  They look much broader than an

            7     individual patient.

            8     Q.  Okay.  What did you do when you finished your

            9     fellowship?

           10     A.  When I finished my fellowship in Connecticut, I went to

           11     the The Centers For Disease Control and Prevention.

           12     Q.  Okay, the CDC, where is that located?

           13     A.  Headquarters was in Atlanta.

           14     Q.  How long did you work for the CDC?

           15     A.  23 years.

           16     Q.  Okay.  Can you describe sort of what did you do when you

           17     first started with the CDC?

           18     A.  When I started there, I was in a training program called

           19     "The Epidemic Intelligence Service," EIS program, where you

           20     have two years of intensive training in epidemiology.  Then

           21     I did a preventative medicine residency and then joined the

           22     staff.

           23     Q.  What does "preventive medicine" mean?

           24     A.  It's focusing on prevention rather than diagnosis and

           25     treatment necessarily.




                                                                            561



            1     Q.  Okay.  And so after you did that at the CDC, what did

            2     you do do next at the CDC?

            3     A.  Well, my EIS time I was actually assigned to the group

            4     called the Hospital Infections Branch, and it changed its

            5     name over time from the Hospital Infections Branch to the

            6     Hospital Infections Program to the Division of Health Care

            7     Quality Promotion, but the bottom line was I spent 22 years

            8     focusing on health care epidemiology and infection control.

            9     Q.  Okay.  Did you design and conduct epidemiologic studies

           10     of adverse events in health care settings?

           11     A.  Yes.

           12     Q.  Okay, can you describe that?

           13     A.  Well, our job to was to try to identify ways to prevent

           14     complications from invasive procedures, catheters, surgical

           15     procedures, anywhere from neonates all the way to geriatric

           16     patients including inpatients and outpatients.

           17     Q.  Okay.  Do you have any any other titles at the CDC when

           18     you worked there?

           19     A.  I was Assistant Chief of the Surveillance Program, which

           20     now is a national surveillance program was then as well.

           21     It's now called the National Health Care Safety Network.

           22     Every hospital in the country now reports to that system.  I

           23     helped develop the system and the definitions for infection

           24     that are used in it.

           25     Q.  Okay.  And I'd like to ask you a little bit about that.




                                                                            562



            1     You said you've been involved in this surveillance and

            2     reporting of surgical infections in hospitals, is that

            3     right?

            4     A.  Correct.

            5     Q.  Could you describe that?

            6     A.  Well, we developed the protocols for what are the

            7     requirements for doing surveillance for infection, how long

            8     do you do surveillance, what are the definitions for

            9     infections because I think it's actually a critically

           10     important element of this trial in that surgical site

           11     infections, which you've often heard either normothermia

           12     reduces surgical site infections.

           13               Well, the problem is surgical site infections is a

           14     global term.  It actually includes three things:

           15               Incisional infections, which are just at the top

           16     of the skin.  Second is deep incisional, which is under the

           17     skin and in the muscle; and then you have the fascia below

           18     that is what's called organ or space, which would be

           19     prosthetic joint infection.  So there's three categories.

           20     So when you say "surgical site infection," it's important to

           21     remember two thirds of surgical site infections are the

           22     skin.  And the path of physiology of how those infections

           23     occur is totally different than from the deep infections.

           24               The skin, the skin flora is very important when I

           25     cut through my skin, I damage it.  The skin flora that's on




                                                                            563



            1     my skin could potentially cause an infection.  But if you're

            2     doing a deep orthopedic procedure, for instance, the skin

            3     that you cut say 20 minutes ago is to a large extent

            4     irrelevant.  It then becomes the organ space, the deep joint

            5     that's important and that's airborne spread.  So you really

            6     have two different mechanisms going on.

            7     Q.  That's okay.  I'm going to put up in a few minutes a

            8     demonstrative, and I think it would be easier to walk

            9     through that with the jury.

           10     A.  Sure.

           11     Q.  We've heard a bit about peer reviewed journals.  What's

           12     your understanding of that?

           13     A.  Peer review means that you send a paper that's submitted

           14     to a journal out for experts in the field to review and give

           15     their opinion on is it a good paper or a bad paper?  I was

           16     actually the editor of a major infection control journal,

           17     infection control in health care epidemiology for two years,

           18     so I was responsible for those papers that would come in.  I

           19     would identify who should review them, send out the review,

           20     and then see what they said about the paper.

           21     Q.  Do you have any peer reviewed articles, Doctor?

           22     A.  I've published over four hundred peer reviewed articles.

           23     Q.  Okay.  So the peer review process for the most part is

           24     an assurance that it's scientifically valid?

           25     A.  Correct, but there certainly is not a perfect system.




                                                                            564



            1     For instance of my four hundred papers, there's one paper

            2     that has been retracted and that was because the paper trail

            3     by the lead author on that study didn't keep as good a

            4     recordkeeping as she should have done.  So, in general, the

            5     peer review process is not perfect, but it is the best that

            6     we can do in trying to make sure that the literature that is

            7     published is scientifically valid.

            8     Q.  I think his microphone went off.  Keep going and talk

            9     loud.

           10     A.  Okay.  Raise your hand if you can't hear me.

           11     Q.  Have you authored any book chapters, Dr. Jarvis?

           12     A.  Probably 100 book chapters and I've edited six books.

           13     Q.  Can you keep your voice up?

           14     A.  I will try.

           15     Q.  You've said you edited or you have written 100 book

           16     chapters in what fields?

           17     A.  Infectious disease, infection control, hospital

           18     epidemiology.

           19     Q.  One of the things I noticed in your CV was something

           20     about the CDC morbidity and mortality weekly reports, what

           21     are those and what was your involvement with those?

           22     A.  CDC publishes each week a document or like almost like a

           23     periodical called, "The Morbidity and Mortality Report" or

           24     most people know it as MMWR, and it's kind of the hot

           25     topics, important news, scientific news that needs to get




                                                                            565



            1     out to the public as well as the news media and the

            2     scientific world, so we publish probably somewhere between

            3     50 and 60 MMWRs during my time at CDC.

            4     Q.  Okay, have you been involved in editing any books?

            5     A.  I edited six books.

            6     Q.  Some of the titles include what, Doctor?

            7     A.  One of them is called hospital infections, basically,

            8     covers a broad range of how to diagnose and prevent hospital

            9     infections.

           10     Q.  Okay.  Can you briefly describe some of the positions

           11     you've held outside of the work that you did at the CDC for

           12     23 years?

           13     A.  You mean during my time at CDC?

           14     Q.  Yes, but not work related to CDC but other positions

           15     that you've held?

           16     A.  Oh, okay.  As I mentioned, I've been editor of the

           17     Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology major journal,

           18     worldwide journal.  I have been president of the Society of

           19     Health Care Epidemiology of America, which is a major

           20     physician organization for infection control and hospital

           21     epidemiology. I have been the president of the research

           22     foundation for the Association for Professionals in

           23     Infection Control, which is the nursing organization with

           24     some physicians.  So helping trying to drive better research

           25     in that group, and I'm currently chairman of the Food and




                                                                            566



            1     Drug Administration Hospital and Personal Use Committee.

            2     Q.  Okay.  How about have you done any work for the American

            3     Society of Microbiology?

            4     A.  In fact, I was chairman of what's called division L,

            5     which is the nosocomial infection section.

            6     Q.  What is nosocomial infection?

            7     A.  It's a term that's not used that commonly now.  I've

            8     heard it several times over the last couple of days.  It

            9     really means an infection that is related to health care, so

           10     it's not present or incubating at the time you come into the

           11     hospital or the health care system and then develops as a

           12     result of your exposure there.

           13     Q.  Okay.  How is your prior experience relevant to the

           14     opinions that I'm going to ask you to talk to the jury about

           15     today?

           16

           17               START HERE

           18     A.  Well, I think in a number of ways.  During my time at

           19     CDC, I was responsible as you mentioned for developing

           20     designing epidemiologic studies, so I spent a lot of time on

           21     study design, how to design studies how to read papers and

           22     critically look at them.  I also been involved for 17 years,

           23     I was in charge of the group within the hospital program at

           24     CDC for all out break investigation and health care

           25     throughout the world.  I also was in charge of the




                                                                            567



            1     development of guidelines for the prevention of these

            2     infections including surgical site infections for 17 years.

            3     So very, very broad experience in all health care

            4     epidemiology and infection control including surgical site

            5     infection prevention.

            6     Q.  Okay.  Have you received any awards, Dr. Jarvis?

            7     A.  Yes.

            8     Q.  Could you just describe a few of those for the jury?

            9     A.  I received the CDC Lifetime Achievement Award that's

           10     given to one person each year.  I received the CDC Lifetime

           11     Achievement Award in Epidemiology that's given to one person

           12     every ten years.  I had a lectureship named after me for an

           13     award for the Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America.

           14     I was actually while I was at CDC, I was in the U.S. Public

           15     Health Service and retired as a captain, and have over 50

           16     U.S. Public Health Service Awards for my work at CDC.

           17     Q.  What do you do now, Doctor?

           18     A.  I'm president of Jason and Jarvis Associates.

           19     Q.  And what does your work at your new firm entail?

           20     A.  We provide consultation in infectious disease, hospital

           21     epidemiology, and infection control, microbiology,

           22     antibiotic resistance throughout the world.

           23     Q.  Can you describe for the ladies and gentlemen of the

           24     jury some of the projects that you're working on?

           25     A.  Right now, actually next week I go to Mexico to make




                                                                            568



            1     several presentations and have discussions with the Ministry

            2     of Health in Mexico on helping countrywide to develop

            3     programs to address antibiotic resistance.  I'm working with

            4     colleagues in Southeast Asia on developing some webinars to

            5     educate a wide variety of countries in infection control and

            6     infectious disease and microbiology personnel on preventing

            7     infections in Southeast Asia.  And I'm working on a webinar

            8     in about a week to provide nationwide to a large hospital

            9     system on prevention of catheter-related blood stream

           10     infections.

           11     Q.  Okay.  And how did you get involved, why did you get

           12     involved in this case?

           13     A.  I received a call a number of years ago about whether

           14     I -- from an epidemiologist in Washington, D.C. -- asking if

           15     I would be interested in reviewing literature about a device

           16     and make an assessment on its safety.

           17     Q.  And that's why you're here; is that right?

           18     A.  Correct.

           19     Q.  And I take it you've been paid for your work in the

           20     case.

           21     A.  Yes.

           22     Q.  Do you know how much?

           23     A.  No.

           24     Q.  Okay.  Do you know how it compares to, for example,

           25     Dr. Wenzel, the infectious disease doctor for 3M?




                                                                            569



            1     A.  Well, from what I heard from Dr. Stonnington and what I

            2     read in depos, Dr. Stonnington and I have been paid

            3     together, I believe, about what Dr. Wenzel got paid for his

            4     report.

            5     Q.  Okay.

            6     A.  One report.

            7     Q.  All right.  Have you done a lot of work on this case?

            8     A.  Massive amount of work, yes.

            9     Q.  And if you could look in your book in front of you,

           10     Doctor, at trial Exhibit 705, P705.

           11     A.  Yes.

           12     Q.  Is that a copy of your CV?

           13     A.  I believe so.

           14     Q.  Okay.  And is that something that you prepare and keep

           15     as part of your ordinary duties in consulting?

           16     A.  Yes.

           17     Q.  And is it accurate?

           18     A.  I hope.

           19               MS. CONLIN:  Okay.  Your Honor, we would offer

           20     Plaintiff's Exhibit 705.

           21               THE COURT:  It's received.

           22               MR. GORDON:  I'm going to object, Your Honor, it's

           23     hearsay.

           24               MS. CONLIN:  8036, Your Honor.

           25               THE COURT:  I'll take a look at it.  Move on.




                                                                            570



            1     I'll take a look at it and see.  Do you have it in front of

            2     you?  At some point, give me a copy of the exhibit so I can

            3     rule on the hearsay objection.

            4               MS. CONLIN:  Absolutely.

            5     BY MS. CONLIN:

            6     Q.  So you started to do this, so I'd like to go to this

            7     next.  You understand that doctor, I mean Mr. Gareis was

            8     diagnosed with an infection after he had hip replacement

            9     surgery in 2010, correct, Doctor?

           10     A.  Correct.

           11     Q.  And are there different, and you started to talk about

           12     this, but there are different types of classifications for

           13     surgical site infections; is that right?

           14     A.  Correct.  CDC, as a part of their surveillance system,

           15     has made definitions so that everybody calls things the same

           16     thing.

           17     Q.  Okay.  And was that something that you were involved in

           18     setting up?

           19     A.  Yes.

           20     Q.  I'd like to direct your attention to Plaintiff's

           21     Exhibit 860 in your book there on page 2.  It's also a

           22     demonstrative to which I believe they have no objection.

           23               THE COURT:  What's the number?

           24               MS. CONLIN:  It is Plaintiff's 1607.  Slide 1.

           25               THE COURT:  You may.  There's no objection to that




                                                                            571



            1     one.

            2     BY MS. CONLIN:

            3     Q.  So you started to talk to the jury about this,

            4     Dr. Jarvis.  Explain from the CDC standpoint someone with

            5     your specialty the differences in classifications of

            6     surgical site infections?

            7     A.  So, if you look at this picture, the skin, you see the

            8     hair follicles there and then the skin, and this area down

            9     to here would be considered a superficial incisional

           10     surgical site infection.  And it's really this deeper tissue

           11     here that's called the deep incisional, and then down here

           12     is organ space, which will comparable to a prosthetic joint

           13     infection.

           14               So I think it's critically important when we're

           15     looking at the literature and risk factors and value of

           16     normothermia, et cetera, et cetera, to keep in mind what

           17     term is being used.  If it's prosthetic joint infection,

           18     we're down here, but if I tell you it's surgical site

           19     infection, it's all of this.  And the risk factors for

           20     infection here are different than there.

           21     Q.  So surgical site infection encompasses all three.  Is

           22     there a different mechanistic approach to what would cause

           23     an infection within those three different areas?

           24     A.  Yes.

           25     Q.  Could you describe that, Doctor?




                                                                            572



            1     A.  If we think of the pathogenic mechanisms for those

            2     infections, there's two studies, excellent studies,

            3     randomized control trial, so the absolute best types of

            4     studies that could be done with large populations of

            5     patients that have been done by one individual, Rabih

            6     Darouiche, at the VA Hospital in Houston, Texas.

            7               In his first study, which he published in the New

            8     England Journal, he was attacking this top layer incisional

            9     surgical site infections, and he randomized patients.  So

           10     it's random, I put you into one group, you into the next

           11     group, you into the next group.  One group got one type of

           12     skin prep called povidone iodine.  The other one got a skin

           13     prep called ChloraPrep that you've heard about,

           14     chlorhexidine with alcohol.  And what they found was these

           15     were patients undergoing a wide variety of surgical

           16     procedures, and they found that when you got chlorhexidine

           17     with alcohol as your skin prep versus povidone iodine, the

           18     surgical site infection rate was significantly decreased.

           19               But if you looked at that carefully, deep organ

           20     space infections did not differ.  What differed was

           21     incisional.  So if you're using an antiseptic on the skin,

           22     particularly chlorhexidine with alcohol, it decreased that

           23     superficial skin infection.

           24               Several years later, the same individual did

           25     another randomized control trial.  In this trial, he decided




                                                                            573



            1     that he would try a new device almost like putting a vacuum

            2     cleaner next to your incision.  It sucked the air from that

            3     incision.  And the purpose of it was to decrease the

            4     particles, and we know that some of those particles carry

            5     bacteria because obviously particles alone without bacteria

            6     or microorganisms can't cause an infection.  It's got to

            7     have microorganisms on it.

            8               So he put this device next to the surgical wound

            9     or surgical incision in some patients but not others.

           10     Again, he randomized it so that all these other confounding

           11     variables would be controlled for.  And very interesting

           12     what he found was that again surgical site infection rate

           13     significantly decreased with the group that had the

           14     intervention.

           15               But when he looked again at these three, he found

           16     that what happened was the superficial didn't change, didn't

           17     make any difference if you sucked the air away from that

           18     incision, but the deep organ space infections significantly

           19     decreased.  And it gives us a very good picture to see that

           20     our superficial skin bugs impact our incisional infections

           21     and have no impact on our deep infections.  And it's

           22     airborne deposit of microorganisms deep into the tissue

           23     that's opened during the surgical procedure that is impacted

           24     by cleaning the air around the incision.

           25     Q.  Okay.  I'd like to talk to you about CDC reporting




                                                                            574



            1     issues on surgical site infections, you mentioned that you

            2     were involved in setting up that program.  Can you describe

            3     that briefly for the ladies and gentlemen of the jury?

            4     A.  When that program began in the late 1970's, the U.S.

            5     was probably one of the first countries to start trying to

            6     do what then was called nosocomial infection surveillance

            7     and that system gradually grew.  And in the mid 80's, it was

            8     modified to make it a little bit simpler.  It started as

            9     hospital-wide and then it focused on intensive care unit in

           10     surgical patients in neonatal intensive care unit patients.

           11     The system at that time was called the National Nosocomial

           12     Infections and Surveillance System, or NNISS.  And

           13     subsequently was revised and called the National Health Care

           14     Safety Network or NHSM, which it's called today.

           15               So virtually every hospital in the United States

           16     today reports to that system.  And then we've heard

           17     Dr. Presnal mentioned, well, Mr. Gareis's surgical deep

           18     prosthetic joint infection wouldn't have been report able.

           19     Well, what he's talking about is would it have been reported

           20     to the CDC system that then those data get dumped up to the

           21     Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

           22     Q.  Up until recently, what was the definition of deep

           23     incisional or organ space infection?  What's the time frame?

           24     A.  Well, when we wrote the protocols and then we wrote the

           25     surgical site infection prevention guide in 1999, it was for




                                                                            575



            1     superficial incisional infections, it was a surveillance

            2     period of 30 days, but for deep incisional and for organ

            3     space infections it was up to 90 days unless you had an

            4     implant because we know that implants are very different

            5     than if you don't have an implant, the number of organisms

            6     to cause an infection is much less, And they may go long

            7     periods of time before that infection presents itself.  So

            8     if you had an implant, the surveillance period was for a

            9     year.

           10     Q.  Okay.  We're going to move into a new area.  Do you want

           11     us to keep going?  Okay.

           12               So I'd like to talk with you about, and we heard

           13     from Dr. Presnal and a little bit from Dr. Stonnington as

           14     well about how infections occur.  And do you have a

           15     demonstrative that would aid in explaining this to the

           16     ladies and gentlemen of the jury?

           17     A.  Yes.

           18     Q.  Okay.

           19               MS. CONLIN:  We would offer for demonstrative

           20     purposes Plaintiff's Exhibit 1607, slide 21, which I believe

           21     there was no objection, Your Honor.

           22               THE COURT:  Go ahead.  You may.

           23     BY MS. CONLIN:

           24     Q.  So explain to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury this

           25     slide that you put together, Dr. Jarvis?




                                                                            576



            1     A.  Well, this is talking about the risk of infection and

            2     you really need to have three things that intercept.  Any

            3     one of them by themselves is not going to be enough.  So you

            4     obviously need a patient.  You need to have the bug or

            5     pathogen and then you need to have to the mode to transmit

            6     that bug to the patient.  And it's really where those three

            7     intercept that little area right in there that describes

            8     really an infection occurring.  If you don't have the

            9     patient, you won't have an infection.  If you don't have a

           10     bug, you won't have an infection.  If you don't have a

           11     mechanism of how to get that bug to the patient, you won't

           12     have an infection.  No matter how many risk factors you

           13     have.

           14     Q.  And when I ask you about that in terms of the risk

           15     factors, we've heard comorbidity or comorbidities described,

           16     what is that Dr. Jarvis?

           17     A.  Comorbidities are what are the other things that you

           18     have such as being very young, being very old, being obese,

           19     having an underlying disease that places you at greater risk

           20     for infection if the bug gets to the site.

           21     Q.  Okay.  If you have comorbidities, can you have an

           22     infection without the bug?

           23     A.  No.

           24     Q.  Is that what you're attempting to illustrate here?

           25     A.  Yes.




                                                                            577



            1     Q.  So I'd like to talk to you a little bit about where bugs

            2     come from in the OR that can cause an infection, and have

            3     you put together a couple demonstratives on this topic as

            4     well to aid the ladies and gentlemen of the jury in

            5     understanding your testimony?

            6     A.  Yes.

            7     Q.  I'd like to direct your attention to 1607, slide 4,

            8     which is labelled endogenous sources of bacteria, what does

            9     that mean?

           10     A.  Well, you're going to hear during this trial about

           11     really two big buckets of sources.  One is endogenous.

           12     Endogenous is what we have on ourselves.  The other is going

           13     to be exogenous, that's outside of ourselves.  And if we

           14     look at endogenous, as I said, it's our bug, so obviously

           15     endogenous flora or patient flora is one potential source.

           16     And as I mentioned, that's a particularly important source

           17     for superficial surgical site infections.  The skin,

           18     obviously, is important for superficial skin infections.

           19               Mucous membranes, there's been some talk about

           20     staph epidermidis or coagulase-negative staphylococci can be

           21     in the nose.  Yeah, it can be.  About 30 percent of the

           22     people in this room have staphylococcus aureus, which is a

           23     much more important organism than staph epidermidis, and a

           24     lot of studies have looked at trying to eradicate that from

           25     the nose particularly in surgical patients, not staph




                                                                            578



            1     epidermidis, staph aureus.

            2               Then the GI tract from seating from a distant

            3     site, you're going to hear something about that, I believe.

            4     Q.  Yes.

            5     A.  Those are more issues that are down the line not at the

            6     time of surgery, the recommendation is if you have a distant

            7     site of infection at the time of surgery, your surgery

            8     shouldn't be done.  That infection should be treated and

            9     then if you're having a clean surgical procedure, then your

           10     surgical procedure is done.  So a distant site of infection

           11     can be a secondary source later down the line.

           12     Q.  Okay.  And we're going to get into your differential or

           13     your diagnosis with respect to Mr. Gareis in a while, but

           14     was there anything in the medical records that you saw that

           15     suggested either a mucous membrane or gastrointestinal tract

           16     infection or seeding from a distant site?

           17     A.  None.

           18     Q.  If you had an infection somewhere else that was going to

           19     seed in the implant based on your experience, what kind of

           20     symptoms would you have?

           21     A.  You would have signs and symptoms of whatever infection

           22     that is.  If you had a urinary tract infection or if you

           23     have a boil somewhere, you'd have signs and symptoms of that

           24     and be diagnosed with that infection.

           25     Q.  Okay.  And you talked a little bit about exogenous




                                                                            579



            1     sources of bacteria.  If we could put up slide 5, please,

            2     Mr. Storwald and explain this as contrasted with the

            3     endogenous or the patient specific sources?

            4     A.  So as I mentioned, the endogenous is inside our cells,

            5     the exogenous is outside our cells.  And, obviously, the

            6     surgical team as we've heard is critically important.  They

            7     can desquamate their flora, they can have soiled attire, and

            8     they can have breaks in aseptic technique.  As we've seen

            9     pictures of the operating room environment and the

           10     ventilation, those are both very important.  It's part of

           11     the reason why we do terminal cleaning at the end of each

           12     day in the operating room and then cleaning in between cases

           13     in the operating room, and the ventilation is very, very

           14     important.

           15     Q.  What does terminal cleaning mean?

           16     A.  Terminal cleaning means at the end of the day in the OR

           17     or if a patient is in a room in a ward when that patient is

           18     discharged, before the next patient comes in either for

           19     surgery in the OR or to be in that room in the hospital,

           20     they do a special type of cleaning that is much more intense

           21     than just coming in here and wiping everything off and that

           22     the goal is to decrease the microbial burden in that area as

           23     much as possible.  It doesn't sterilize it, but it decreases

           24     the microbes as much as you can.

           25               And even now we're seeing in operating rooms and




                                                                            580



            1     ward rooms the use of little robot UV machines now and

            2     hydrogen peroxide, so there is additional ways that are

            3     being developed to make it even safer.

            4     Q.  And we're going to be talking about the specific

            5     equipment in Mr. Gareis's surgery, but based on your review

            6     of the records and the physicians' testimony, was there any

            7     other device in Mr. Gareis's surgery that warmed up

            8     nonsterile air and warmed the patient with it?

            9     A.  No.

           10     Q.  Do you know how much waste heat is given off of this

           11     device based on your review of the record?

           12     A.  My understanding is about 800 watts.  More than anything

           13     else in the operating room, by far.

           14     Q.  So I'd like to talk to you a little bit, Doctor, as well

           15     about implant issues, and we've heard a lot about sort of

           16     the biofilm.  I'd like to talk to you about it as a person

           17     who has expertise in epidemiology and infectious disease.

           18     If we could put up, Mr. Storwald, Plaintiff's Exhibit 1607,

           19     page 32, please.

           20               What are we seeing here, Dr. Jarvis?

           21     A.  You've heard about biofilm and you heard about

           22     coagulant-negative staphylococci.  This is a prosthetic

           23     device with a biofilm and coagulant-negative staphylococci

           24     seen with electron microscopy.  Obviously, if we were

           25     looking at it like that, we wouldn't be able to see it.  So




                                                                            581



            1     it's highly magnified with electron microscopy.

            2     Q.  And we heard testimony about the fact that there's

            3     special risks associated with doing surgery where you're

            4     going to be implanting a device?

            5     A.  Correct.

            6     Q.  And do you agree with what Dr. Stonnington and

            7     Dr. Presnal have said on that?

            8     A.  Absolutely.  There's multiple studies including animal

            9     studies showing that much fewer organisms are required to

           10     cause an infection when you have an implant.  If I were to

           11     take a syringe with bacteria in it and inject it under your

           12     skin, I would need somewhere between ten to the four and ten

           13     to the six organisms in order to cause you to have a little

           14     boil infection.

           15               On the other hand, if I put an implant in you, as

           16     low as 1, 10, 50, certainly less than one hundred organisms

           17     are required.  So the magnitude needed, magnitude in terms

           18     of number of organisms needed to cause an infection are

           19     almost infinitesimal compared to if you don't have an

           20     implant.

           21     Q.  And is that opinion consistent with the published

           22     literature, Dr. Jarvis?

           23     A.  Absolutely.

           24     Q.  Okay.  I'd like to direct your attention in your book to

           25     Plaintiff's Exhibit 836.  836.




                                                                            582



            1     A.  836.  Okay.

            2     Q.  And what's the title of this?

            3     A.  "The Role of Clothing and Drapes in the Operating Room."

            4     Q.  What publication was this published?

            5     A.  This is in the Journal of Hospital Infection.

            6     Q.  Is that something that you would consider authoritative

            7     and rely upon in your field of work?

            8     A.  Yes.

            9               MS. CONLIN:  We would offer Plaintiff's

           10     Exhibit 836 under 803(18).

           11               MR. GORDON:  The same objection as we went through

           12     yesterday with the medical journals.

           13               THE COURT:  What page it is this?

           14               MS. CONLIN:  This is Plaintiff's Exhibit 836.

           15               THE COURT:  And you said page 18?

           16               MS. CONLIN:  I'm sorry, page 11 of it, Your Honor,

           17     internal page 11 or I mean that's where I'm going to direct

           18     him to.

           19               THE COURT:  Okay, members of the jury, 15-minute

           20     break.

           21               (Jury out at 2:15 p.m.)

           22               THE COURT:  I'll remain.  Can you bring me what

           23     you're looking at?  Mr. Gordon?

           24               (Sidebar discussion.)

           25               THE COURT:  Okay.  What is this?

            1               MR. GORDON:  It's a journal article.

            2               THE COURT:  And you're going to call it to his

            3     attention, fine.

            4               MS. CONLIN:  Yeah.

            5               MR. GORDON:  Same thing as yesterday no

            6     publication, no.

            7               THE COURT:  She hasn't done that yet, that's what

            8     I was thrown by.

            9               MR. GORDON:  Oh, I misunderstood.

           10               THE COURT:  No, that's okay.  Your ready?

           11               MR. GORDON:  I'm ready -- my voice may not be, but

           12     I'm trying.

           13               MS. CONLIN:  As long as we're here, I understand

           14     Your Honor's order, and I will just have him read it as

           15     you've indicated.  There are some of these that have graphs

           16     in them and --

           17               THE COURT:  As I said, we'll take them one at a

           18     time.

           19               MS. CONLIN:  Okay.  Fair enough.

           20               THE COURT:  I think that's what we should do right

           21     now.

            6               Please be seated, everybody.

            7               MS. CONLIN:  Your Honor, when we broke, I had

            8     offered Plaintiffs' Exhibit 836 as -- under Rule 803(18).

            9               THE COURT:  Okay.  Just to read, not to

           10     actually -- you may proceed.

           11               MS. CONLIN:  Thank you, Your Honor.

           12     BY MS. CONLIN:

           13     Q.  And, Dr. Jarvis, do you have that article in front of

           14     you?

           15     A.  Yes, ma'am.

           16     Q.  And just to remind the jury, the name of this is what?

           17     A.  The role of clothing and drapes in the operating room.

           18     Q.  Okay.  And who is the author?

           19     A.  Debbie Whyte.

           20     Q.  Okay.  And if I could direct your attention,

           21     Dr. Jarvis, to Plaintiffs' Exhibit 836, page 10.

           22     A.  Okay.

           23     Q.  Which should be internal page 11.  Do you have that,

           24     sir?

           25     A.  Yes.


                                  
                                        
                                                                             585



            1     Q.  If you could look down midway through that paragraph,

            2     it reads, "As discussed previously, orthopedic operations

            3     are more susceptible to organisms of less pathogenicity (a

            4     number of these are to be found in the mouth) and the

            5     inoculum of bacteria to initiate an infection is smaller

            6     because of the presence of foreign material."

            7               What's that saying?

            8     A.  It's saying that basically if you have a piece of

            9     foreign material, like an implant, that the number of

           10     organisms that you need in order to cause an infection is

           11     much lower.

           12     Q.  Okay.  I would also like to direct your attention,

           13     then, Dr. Jarvis, to Plaintiffs' Exhibit 795.

           14     A.  Okay.

           15     Q.  And what's the title of this article, Doctor?

           16     A.  Airborne contamination of wounds in joint replacement

           17     operations:  The relationship to sepsis rates.

           18     Q.  Okay.  And where was this published?

           19     A.  Again, in the Journal of Hospital Infection.

           20     Q.  Okay.  And you consider that an authoritative body?

           21     A.  Yes.

           22     Q.  Okay.

           23               MS. CONLIN:  We would offer Plaintiff's

           24     Exhibit 795 under 803(18).

           25               MR. COREY GORDON:  Subject to the --


                                  
                                        
                                                                             586



            1               THE COURT:  Okay.  The reliance factor of

            2     803(18).  Do you want to establish that?

            3     BY MS. CONLIN:

            4     Q.  Was this something you reviewed and relied on in

            5     connection with your opinions in this case?

            6     A.  Yes.

            7     Q.  Okay.  Do you consider it authoritative?

            8     A.  Yes.

            9               THE COURT:  Okay.

           10               MS. CONLIN:  Thank you, Your Honor.

           11     BY MS. CONLIN:

           12     Q.  If you could take a look at page 20 of this.  By the

           13     way, before we get there, Doctor, what did this study

           14     involve?

           15     A.  I was looking at operating rooms in the United Kingdom

           16     in airborne contamination and joint replacements

           17     procedures.

           18     Q.  If we could look again at the last paragraph of this

           19     article, could you read starting with, "however"?

           20     A.  "However, it is clear from the results obtained that by

           21     far the greater part of the bacteria wound contamination

           22     and operations for total joint replacement is derived from

           23     the air when these are done in a conventionally-ventilated

           24     operating room."

           25     Q.  What import, if any, Doctor, did that have to your


                                  
                                        
                                                                             587



            1     opinions in this case?

            2     A.  Well, it's another piece of evidence to show that

            3     airborne contamination is a major root of transmitting the

            4     organism to the site of infection.

            5     Q.  Okay.  And the fact that this was an orthopedic surgery

            6     with an implant, from your standpoint as somebody skilled

            7     in your field, what is the view of you as to the fact that

            8     the Bair Hugger was in the room?

            9     A.  I'm not -- you mean in -- Bair Hugger wasn't in the

           10     room in --

           11     Q.  No, no.  I meant how this article impacts your opinions

           12     in this case to Mr. Gareis's surgery involving the Bair

           13     Hugger?

           14     A.  Well, we know that the Bair Hugger withdraws air from

           15     the room, which isn't sterile, and then blows that into the

           16     blanket and as a result can increase particles both through

           17     that and through the excess heat --

           18               MR. COREY GORDON:  Objection, Your Honor.  102.

           19               THE COURT:  Sustained.

           20               MR. COREY GORDON:  Move to strike.

           21               MS. CONLIN:  I'll move on, Your Honor.

           22               THE COURT:  Okay.  The motion to strike is

           23     granted.

           24               And, Ms. Conlin, that's a good idea.

           25               MS. CONLIN:  Okay.


                                  
                                        
                                                                             588



            1     BY MS. CONLIN:

            2     Q.  You know that in the Gareis OR, it was known as ultra

            3     clean or had unidirectional air, correct?

            4     A.  Correct.

            5     Q.  Okay.  And in this study that we just looked at, that

            6     was talking about a different type of setup, one that

            7     didn't have unidirectional air?

            8     A.  Right.  Conventional air.

            9     Q.  Okay.  And did you see things in the record as to what

           10     Dr. Presnal did to ensure the room was as clean as possible

           11     and the surgery was conducted appropriately?

           12     A.  Yes.

           13     Q.  Okay.  And do you agree based on your review of the

           14     literature that surgeons doing orthopedic surgeries

           15     involving implants do everything they can to reduce the

           16     particulate counts?

           17     A.  They should.

           18     Q.  Okay.  Now I want to turn to normothermia, and we've

           19     heard a lot about that, including -- you were here during

           20     Dr. Kurz's deposition clip, correct, sir?

           21     A.  Most of it, yes.

           22     Q.  And normothermia is just a fancy way of saying keeping

           23     a patient warm during surgery?

           24     A.  Correct.

           25     Q.  Okay.  And have you looked for clinical evidence that


                                  
                                        
                                                                             589



            1     maintaining normothermia reduces the incidence of

            2     prosthetic joint infections?

            3     A.  In orthopedic surgery patients, yes.

            4     Q.  And have you found any?

            5     A.  No.

            6     Q.  You have looked at the Kurz study, right, Doctor?

            7     A.  Yes.  That was a colon surgery.

            8     Q.  Okay.  I would like to direct your attention to

            9     Plaintiffs' Exhibit 790.

           10     A.  Okay.

           11     Q.  And is this the Kurz study?

           12     A.  Yes.

           13     Q.  Okay.  And where was it published?

           14     A.  New England Journal of Medicine.

           15     Q.  And what year?

           16     A.  1996, May.

           17     Q.  Okay.  And we heard a little bit about it during the

           18     Kurz deposition, but can you just summarize what the study

           19     did for the Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury?

           20     A.  This study took a group of patients undergoing colon

           21     surgery, so that tends to be clean contaminated,

           22     contaminated or dirty surgeries, and then randomized them

           23     between getting a Bair Hugger that was kept on ambient

           24     versus a Bair Hugger that was heating the air to try to

           25     maintain core body -- normothermia body temperature in the


                                  
                                        
                                                                             590



            1     latter group and not in the former group and then looking

            2     at outcomes.

            3     Q.  Okay.  Does the considerations with colorectal surgery

            4     have in your mind any impact on an orthopedic surgery of

            5     less than an hour and a half?

            6     A.  No.  They're totally different.  One, the abdomen is

            7     open for three to four hours.  In the operating room you're

            8     dealing with cutting the bowel, where you have feces, so

            9     you have a lot of bugs, much higher risk of infection

           10     regardless of warming or not warming, compared to a joint

           11     procedure where the risk of surgery is -- a risk of

           12     infection with implant is around 1 percent or slightly

           13     less.

           14     Q.  Okay.  I would like to direct your attention, Doctor,

           15     to Plaintiffs' demonstrative Exhibit 1607, slide 9.

           16               MR. COREY GORDON:  I object.  Hearsay.

           17               MS. CONLIN:  It was just --

           18               THE COURT:  Go ahead.  You can show it.

           19               MS. CONLIN:  Thank you.

           20     BY MS. CONLIN:

           21     Q.  And this is actually an excerpt out of the deposition

           22     that we just heard from Dr. Kurz.  And if you can tell the

           23     Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury what import, if any, this

           24     testimony had on the opinions that you've rendered in this

           25     case as it relates to normothermia.


                                  
                                        
                                                                             591



            1     A.  Well, to me, the Kurz study was really pivotal.  Most

            2     clinicians who are recommending the importance of

            3     normothermia base it on this paper, and we know that the

            4     paper today, you couldn't do the study, number one.  Number

            5     two, even if you could do the study, it probably wouldn't

            6     be accepted because patients today are very, very, very

            7     different than at this time, and at this time they were

            8     admitted to the hospital for days before the surgical

            9     procedure.  The surgical procedure was much longer.  They

           10     stayed in the hospital much longer after the surgical

           11     procedure.  Skin prep was totally different.  Antimicrobial

           12     prophylaxis was different.  So there is a large number of

           13     factors that influence or could confound the results of the

           14     study.  It would be very different if the study were done

           15     today.

           16     Q.  Have you found a single study that has indicated that

           17     maintaining normothermia or using active warming during an

           18     orthopedic procedure of less than, say, two hours has any

           19     clinical benefit?

           20     A.  None.

           21     Q.  What does the fact that there is no evidence to support

           22     the use in an orthopedic implant surgery of less than two

           23     hours, what impact does that have on your opinions in this

           24     case?

           25     A.  Oh, I think given all of the things that we know


                                  
                                        
                                                                             592



            1     Dr. Presnal and many other surgeons do to reduce the risk

            2     of an infection occurring in an orthopedic implant patient,

            3     why would you then bring a device into the room that

            4     withdraws nonsterile air, blows it into the operative field

            5     and has --

            6               MR. COREY GORDON:  Your Honor, objection.

            7               THE COURT:  Sustained.  Sustained.

            8               MS. CONLIN:  May we approach?

            9               THE COURT:  It's the same objection as before.

           10               MS. CONLIN:  Okay.

           11               MR. COREY GORDON:  Also move to strike, Your

           12     Honor.

           13     BY MS. CONLIN:

           14     Q.  Does part of your opinion deal with the fact that the

           15     Bair Hugger creates waste heat as described by

           16     Dr. Stonnington?

           17     A.  Correct.

           18     Q.  What import, if any, does that have on your opinion as

           19     it relates to the necessity of maintaining normothermia in

           20     orthopedic surgery?

           21     A.  Well, on the one side -- you know, we're looking at

           22     balancing harm versus benefit.  There is no study to show

           23     any benefit.  And there is potential harm with excess heat

            1     bacteria and potentially causing an infection.

            2               MR. COREY GORDON:  Again, Your Honor, MIL 2.

            3               THE COURT:  That can stand.  Next question.

            4               MS. CONLIN.  Yes.

            5     BY MS. CONLIN:

            6     Q.  I would like to direct your attention, Dr. Jarvis, to

            7     Plaintiffs' demonstrative Exhibit 1607, slide 23.

            8               MR. COREY GORDON:  Objection, Your Honor.  This

            9     is a Rule 26 scope issue.  Also foundation.

           10               THE COURT:  We'll see.  I don't know how you're

           11     going to use it.  Go ahead.

           12     BY MS. CONLIN:

           13     Q.  You were here during opening statements, correct?

           14     A.  Yes, ma'am.

           15     Q.  And did you see a slide that was put up by the

           16     attorneys for 3M involving patient warming improves --

           17               THE COURT:  Argumentative.  This is from an

           18     opening statement?

           19               MS. CONLIN:  Yeah.

           20               THE COURT:  Okay.  The objection is sustained.

           21               MS. CONLIN:  Okay.

           22     BY MS. CONLIN:

           23     Q.  And you recall that there were a number of benefits

           24     listed for improving patient outcomes, correct?

           25     A.  Yes.


                                  
                                        
                                                                             594



            1     Q.  Okay.  And one of them was surgical site infections,

            2     correct?

            3     A.  Correct.

            4     Q.  Based on your extensive review of the record, did you

            5     see any evidence that maintaining normothermia during an

            6     orthopedic implant surgery the length of Mr. Gareis's or

            7     approximately around that length of time decreased surgical

            8     site infections?

            9     A.  I didn't see any that decreased surgical site

           10     infections or prosthetic joint infections, specifically.

           11     Q.  How about fatal heart attacks?

           12               MR. COREY GORDON:  I renew my objection, Your

           13     Honor.

           14               THE COURT:  Overruled.

           15     BY MS. CONLIN:

           16     Q.  How about fatal heart attacks?

           17     A.  None.

           18     Q.  Okay.  How about blood transfusions?

           19               MR. COREY GORDON:  Same objection, Your Honor.

           20               THE COURT:  Overruled.

           21               THE WITNESS:  None.

           22     BY MS. CONLIN:

           23     Q.  How about length of hospital stay?

           24     A.  None.

           25     Q.  How about post operative shivering?


                                  
                                        
                                                                             595



            1     A.  I did not see any papers on that with orthopedic

            2     implant procedures.

            3     Q.  I would like to turn your attention back to the bug

            4     that caused Mr. Gareis's deep joint infection,

            5     Staphylococcus epidermis or Staph epi?

            6     A.  Correct.

            7     Q.  Okay.  Did you put together some slides to explain to

            8     the Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury what kind of bug that

            9     is?

           10     A.  Yes.

           11     Q.  Okay.  I would like to direct your attention to

           12     Plaintiffs' 1607, slide 28, which we would offer for

           13     demonstrative purposes, as well as the other 1607 slides

           14     that we've shown.

           15               THE COURT:  Received for that purpose.

           16               MS. CONLIN:  All right.

           17     BY MS. CONLIN:

           18     Q.  What are we looking at?

           19               THE COURT:  Members of the Jury, here's what that

           20     means.  I talked to you quite a bit at the beginning of the

           21     trial about what evidence is and isn't, and this isn't

           22     evidence like that, but it's demonstrative, meaning that it

           23     can be used with this witness to the extent you find it

           24     helpful in understanding the witness's testimony, so that's

           25     what -- that's what that back and forth was about.


                                  
                                        
                                                                             596



            1               MS. CONLIN:  And I think I forgot to offer for

            2     demonstrative purposes slides 1214 and 32 of 1607, which we

            3     went through before the break.

            4     BY MR. CONLIN:

            5     Q.  So what are we looking at, Dr. Jarvis?

            6     A.  This is a culture plate, and what they have done is

            7     taken basically a dot, a bug, and streaked it on the plate.

            8     And on the right-hand side you have Staphylococcus aureus.

            9     In this room, if we were to culture the nose of everybody

           10     in this room, 30 percent of the people in this room would

           11     have Staph aureus at any one time.  And on the left is

           12     Staphylococcus epidermidis.  So if we just said

           13     Staphylococcus species, kind of like we talked about

           14     surgical site infections having three categories, lump them

           15     into one, if I said Staphylococcus species, it would cover

           16     both of those.  But when you speciate them by doing

           17     biochemical tests, you can differentiate Staphylococcus

           18     aureus from Staphylococcus epidermis.

           19     Q.  If we can take a look at slide 29 out of Plaintiffs'

           20     Exhibit 67, which we would offer for demonstrative

           21     purposes, what are we looking at here?

           22     A.  That's just another plate with the same thing.  And you

           23     can see, if you're just looking at that plate, if I asked

           24     you is that Staphylococcus aureus or Staphylococcus

           25     epidermis, you really can't tell.  They look the same.


                                  
                                        
                                                                             597



            1     Q.  Well, actually, that raises a good point I would like

            2     to clarify for the Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury.  You

            3     were here when Dr. Presnal's deposition was played,

            4     correct?

            5     A.  Yes.

            6     Q.  And do you recall him talking about the fact that

            7     looking at the stain of the bug he couldn't tell where it

            8     came from?

            9     A.  Correct.

           10     Q.  Okay.  What did that mean to you?

           11     A.  Well, if you look at this plate or if you looked at a

           12     stain, what's called a Gram stain that stains these bugs so

           13     you can see them under a microscope, it doesn't tell you

           14     anything about where they came from.  Unless I told you

           15     where I cultured them from, you would have no idea where

           16     they were even at.

           17     Q.  But that's a different issue than when you were finding

           18     out when you were inoculated with the bug, correct?

           19     A.  Correct.

           20     Q.  And that's the investigation that you did?

           21     A.  Correct.

           22     Q.  Okay.  If we could direct your attention to

           23     Plaintiffs's demonstrative Exhibit 1607, slide 30, which we

           24     would offer for demonstrative purposes.

           25               What are we looking at here, Dr. Jarvis?


                                  
                                        
                                                                             598



            1     A.  So this is just showing you that once you have this

            2     Staphylococcus, you could do a Gram stain and see that it's

            3     a Gram-positive, so it will be a purple-looking bug under a

            4     microscope.  Then you do this very simple test in the test

            5     tube called a coagulase test.  And if it's coagulase

            6     positive, that means it's Staphylococcus aureus.  If it's

            7     coagulase negative, and we have heard coagulase negative

            8     Staphylococci, it puts it into that category.  And of all

            9     of the coagulase negative Staphylococci, Staphylococcus

           10     epidermidis is the most common one.

           11     Q.  Okay.  And we've heard a lot of testimony about the

           12     fact that it's a common bug on your skin; is that right?

           13     A.  Correct.

           14     Q.  Is it a common bug deep down in your hip where an

           15     implant is?

           16     A.  No.  That would be sterile.

           17     Q.  Okay.  And so by what mechanism could a Staph epi bug

           18     end up on an implant?

           19     A.  The primary mechanism would be airborne.

           20     Q.  And there was also some testimony about the fact that

           21     this is a slow-growing bug.  Do you agree with that

           22     assessment?

           23     A.  Well, everything is relative, but if it's in a biofilm,

           24     one of the advantages that the organism has when it's in a

           25     biofilm is they can down regulate their growth, they can


                                  
                                        
                                                                             599



            1     exchange genetic material among themselves.  So compared to

            2     an organism such as the coagulase positive or

            3     Staphylococcus aureus that I showed you, that would tend to

            4     grow much faster.  It has enzymes in it that allow it to

            5     burrow through tissue much more rapidly.  So you are going

            6     to have more clinical signs and symptoms with a Staph

            7     aureus infection than you would have with a Staphylococcus

            8     epidermis infection.

            9     Q.  Okay.  I would like to direct your attention to

           10     Plaintiffs' Trial Exhibit 1607, slide 35, which we would

           11     offer for demonstrative purposes.

           12               And you've mentioned biofilm.  Can you describe

           13     this visual for the Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury in

           14     connection with the creation of biofilm and how it can

           15     smolder for a long time before exhibiting itself?

           16     A.  Sure.  So on this slide, if you thought of that gray

           17     almost like table as an implant, the organism in 1 is

           18     landing on it; and when they land on it, they attach

           19     themselves and then they produce what's called an

           20     exopolysaccharide or biofilm or, as Dr. Stonnington said,

           21     slime that covers themselves and, as he mentioned, that

           22     coverage or biofilm or slime helps to protect them.  It's a

           23     defense mechanism for the organism.  The organism is saying

           24     I want to live here, I want to grow and proliferate here,

           25     which we as humans don't want it to do, but it wants to do,


                                  
                                        
                                                                             600



            1     so it has developed mechanisms to help it do that.

            2               One of the ways is to put this shield or

            3     fortress, as Dr. Stonnington talked about, through this

            4     slime or biofilm that then prevents the blood and our

            5     immune system cells from getting to it or the antibiotics

            6     in our blood getting to it or you need very high levels of

            7     antibiotic to try to drive it in.  As you can see, they

            8     gradually produce in no. 2 a little bit of slime and then

            9     in no. 3 it's even more; and within that slime, they are

           10     exchanging genetic, basically talking to one another.  It's

           11     a community.  They're talking to one another.  They're

           12     growing.  If they feel like they're growing too fast, they

           13     can send a signal to one another and say let's slow down

           14     here.

           15               So they gradually grow to larger numbers, and

           16     then at some point they break through the slime and can get

           17     into the other tissue or get into the bloodstream.

           18     Q.  Okay.  I would like to switch gears now, Dr. Jarvis,

           19     and talk to you about the methodology that you employed in

           20     arriving at the conclusions and your opinions that we're

           21     going to be talking about.  Okay?

           22     A.  Okay.

           23     Q.  Did you review a number of journal articles and medical

           24     studies?

           25     A.  Everything I could find.


                                  
                                        
                                                                             601



            1     Q.  Okay.  How arduous was that undertaking?

            2     A.  Well, it took a lot of time because I tried to review

            3     as much of the literature as I could find, both in terms of

            4     normothermia, risk factors for prosthetic joint infection,

            5     the impact of particles, correlation between particles and

            6     bugs or colony-forming units, virtually everything I could

            7     try to find on the subject.

            8     Q.  Okay.  And did you also review a number of expert

            9     reports both by the plaintiffs as well as the defense

           10     experts?

           11     A.  Correct.  Yes.

           12     Q.  Okay.  And did you review deposition testimony and

           13     documents that were exchanged between the parties in the

           14     case?

           15     A.  Yes.

           16     Q.  Okay.  So describe the methodology that you did in

           17     arriving at your conclusions here.

           18     A.  Well, first was reading Mr. Gareis's medical records,

           19     and then was looking at all of the peer-reviewed published

           20     literature that I could find that addressed the subject in

           21     evaluating those papers, and then looking at expert reports

           22     and depositions to see do they substantiate, conflict with

           23     what's in the literature, and then reaching an opinion

           24     balancing all of that.

           25     Q.  Okay.  Now, you mentioned before that you had seen --


                                  
                                        
                                                                             602



            1     or have you seen scientific literature relating to whether

            2     airborne contamination can cause prosthetic joint

            3     infections like the one that Mr. Gareis suffered from?

            4     A.  Yes.

            5     Q.  Okay.  Is that something that is well recognized?

            6     A.  Absolutely.

            7     Q.  Okay.  I would like to direct your attention,

            8     Dr. Jarvis, to Plaintiffs' Exhibit 795.  And that was the

            9     reference we talked about before, correct, Doctor?

           10     A.  Correct.

           11     Q.  And I think you read the last sentence about that the

           12     results obtained through that study by far found that the

           13     greater part of bacterial wound contamination in operations

           14     for joint replacement is derived from air; is that correct?

           15     A.  Correct.

           16     Q.  And did that weigh on your opinion?

           17     A.  Yes.

           18     Q.  Okay.  I would like to direct your attention as well to

           19     Plaintiffs' Exhibit 530.  And what's the title of

           20     Plaintiffs' Exhibit 530?

           21     A.  Association of Airborne Microorganisms in the Operating

           22     Room With Implant Infections:  A Randomized Controlled

           23     Trial.

           24     Q.  And where was this published?

           25     A.  In Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology.


                                  
                                        
                                                                             603



            1     Q.  Okay.  And what's the date of this?

            2     A.  January 2017.

            3     Q.  Okay.  Do you consider the Infection Control and

            4     Hospital Epidemiology journal to be authoritative?

            5     A.  Yes.

            6     Q.  And is it something that folks like yourself would rely

            7     upon in connection with their work?

            8     A.  Yes.  This is the one I mentioned that I was the editor

            9     of.

           10     Q.  Okay.  And did you rely on this article in forming your

           11     opinions in this case?

           12     A.  Yes.

           13               MS. CONLIN:  Okay.  We would offer Plaintiffs'

           14     Exhibit 530 under 803(18).

           15               THE COURT:  You may proceed.

           16               MS. CONLIN:  Thank you, Your Honor.

           17     BY MS. CONLIN:

           18     Q.  If you could just describe what they were attempting to

           19     do in this study, Dr. Jarvis?

           20     A.  Well, this is the study that I mentioned to you by

           21     Darouiche from the VA in Houston where he randomized

           22     patients to two different arms.  One was -- I mentioned

           23     vacuum cleaner.  I probably carried that analogy a little

           24     bit too far.  It looks like the end of a vacuum cleaner,

           25     kind of like that (indicating), but it's actually not


                                  
                                        
                                                                             604



            1     sucking.  It's blowing HEPA-filtered air.  So HEPA

            2     filtration, which is what operating rooms have as usually

            3     one of the last filters before it comes into the operating

            4     room, they filter out 99.97, so almost 100 percent of

            5     particles that are 0.3 microns or bigger.

            6               Now, to give you a sense of 0.3 microns, if I

            7     took a hair off of any one of you and just held it up, it's

            8     less than 40 microns.  And we're talking about .3 microns.

            9     So it gets very small particles and anything bigger than

           10     that and stops it from getting into the room.

           11               In this study they used a device that they put

           12     right next to the incision that looks a little bit like the

           13     end of a vacuum cleaner, and it blew this HEPA-filtered air

           14     over the incision.  So it's similar to the air coming down,

           15     the laminar flow or unidirectional airflow, where the air

           16     is coming down, having basically a protective shield to

           17     blow particles away from the operative field.  This is

           18     blowing it across the incision during the time they're

           19     doing the surgery.

           20               So the question these authors were asking was, if

           21     we make the area right around the incision really, really,

           22     really super clean, what impact is it?

           23     Q.  Okay.  And if I can stop you there, if you can look at

           24     the first page of this Darouiche study, Dr. Jarvis, on the

           25     left-hand side, the very last sentence starting with


                                  
                                        
                                                                             605



            1     "Thus," if you could read that to the Ladies and Gentlemen

            2     of the Jury?

            3     A.  "The primary source of these airborne

            4     microorganisms" --

            5     Q.  Page one on the right-hand side.  I might have said

            6     left.  I apologize.  You can read that, too, if you want,

            7     but what I want to do is direct your attention to the

            8     right-hand side, the last sentence there, the purpose of

            9     the study.

           10     A.  "Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate

           11     whether airborne CFU," which is colony-forming units or

           12     bacteria, "density at the incision site during operation is

           13     related to the incidence of incisional or implant

           14     infections after placing the prosthesis."

           15     Q.  Okay.  So they were looking at both superficial as well

           16     as deep?

           17     A.  Correct.

           18     Q.  Okay.  And if I could direct your attention to Figure 4

           19     of this.

           20               And, Your Honor, I would request publication of

           21     Figure 4 to the jury for him to explain what the authors

           22     concluded.

           23               THE COURT:  Is that going to help you in

           24     expressing your own opinion, Dr. Jarvis?

           25               THE WITNESS:  Excuse me?


                                  
                                        
                                                                             606



            1     BY MS. CONLIN:

            2     Q.  Is it going to help you in expressing your opinion and

            3     the conclusions that you drew from this article?

            4     A.  Yes.

            5               THE COURT:  All right.  Go ahead.

            6     BY MS. CONLIN:

            7     Q.  If we could publish Figure 4, which is on 530.  There

            8     we go.

            9               What are we seeing here, Dr. Jarvis?

           10     A.  So this is a graph of the density or how much, how many

           11     colony-forming units were at the incision site, and then

           12     does it correlate with implant infection, and you can see

           13     the p-value there, which is what is the statistical

           14     importance of this, and it shows it's highly statistically

           15     significant, and you can see as you move from the left-hand

           16     side at 0 median CFU --

           17     Q.  And what does that mean?  Explain it.

           18     A.  CFU per meter squared, so in testing the air through a

           19     sampler, they find no colony-forming units, that the

           20     probability of a prosthetic infection is pretty close to

           21     zero and that it increases as you move to the right.

           22               As you have more colony-forming units, the risk

           23     of a prosthetic joint infection increases.

           24     Q.  Is that the curved line that is going up like this

           25     (indicating)?


                                  
                                        
                                                                             607



            1     A.  Right.  That dotted line, the solid line is the line

            2     that they detected, and then the dotted lines are what is

            3     called a 95 percent confidence interval.  So the true

            4     answer lies between those two lines, but the bottom line

            5     message is that as you increase the number of

            6     colony-forming units, the risk of an implant infection

            7     increases.

            8     Q.  Okay.  And you mentioned that this was a randomized

            9     controlled trial.  What does that mean, Doctor?

           10     A.  It means that they took this group of patients and

           11     randomly assigned them to either have this intervention or

           12     not have the intervention, and by doing that, they

           13     increased the probability that any factor that exists,

           14     diabetes, obesity, old age, you name it, ends up being even

           15     between the two groups.

           16     Q.  Okay.  Now if could I direct your attention,

           17     Dr. Jarvis, to page 6 of this, and I would like to direct

           18     your attention to the paragraph starting at the bottom --

           19     I'm sorry -- the paragraph starting at the bottom of the

           20     left-hand column, "With our study," and if you could read

           21     that to the Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury and explain

           22     the import, if any, to the opinions that you're reaching in

           23     this case?

           24     A.  "Our study indicates that airborne CFU entering

           25     incisions during operations is a likely source of


                                  
                                        
                                                                             608



            1     contamination leading to implant infections.  Incisional

            2     infections, however, may result from a broader set of

            3     intraoperative and postsurgical factors."

            4               So what they're saying is that as we described

            5     earlier, that this study showed that when you use this HEPA

            6     air over the incision, kind of surprisingly it didn't have

            7     any impact on incisional infections because those are more

            8     related to the bugs that are on your skin to begin with,

            9     but they did significantly decrease the deeper infections,

           10     because the deeper infections, the prosthetic joint

           11     infections, are related to airborne transmission of the

           12     organisms.

           13     Q.  If I could direct your attention to the right-hand

           14     column on that same page in Exhibit 530, and if you could

           15     read the conclusions to the Ladies and Gentlemen of the

           16     Jury?

           17     A.  It says, "In conclusion, our results indicate that CFU

           18     contamination of air at the incision site is a risk factor

           19     for implant but not incisional infections."

           20     Q.  Okay.  And is that consistent with the other literature

           21     that you reviewed?

           22     A.  Correct.  And they also point out that the CFU

           23     contamination is related to the particulate density, so

           24     particles matter.

           25     Q.  Let's talk -- the jury has heard a bit about this


                                  
                                        
                                                                             609



            1     already, but explain to them from your standpoint, from

            2     your field of expertise, this issue of particulates versus

            3     bacteria?

            4     A.  Well, usually bacteria, as was mentioned, they don't

            5     have legs.  They can't migrate on inanimate objects, so

            6     they need to have a vehicle to get from point A to point B,

            7     and the easiest way and best way that they have kind of

            8     evolved is to use particles because particles are very

            9     light.  We can't see them, and they float in the air and go

           10     with the breeze.

           11               So they can attach themselves to those particles

           12     and use them as a way to get from point A to point B.

           13     Q.  Okay.  And did you look at any literature, find any

           14     literature relating to the issue of whether there is an

           15     increased particulate count over the surgical site when the

           16     Bair Hugger is used?

           17     A.  Yes.

           18     Q.  And what did they -- what did those studies show?

           19     A.  Virtually every study showed that there was increased

           20     particle counts when the Bair Hugger was used.

           21     Q.  Okay.  I would like to direct your attention,

           22     Dr. Jarvis, to Plaintiffs' Exhibit 94.  If you could read

           23     the name of the article?

           24     A.  Do Forced Air Patient Warming Devices Disrupt

           25     Unidirectional Downward Airflow?


                                  
                                        
                                                                             610



            1     Q.  Where was this published?

            2     A.  In the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery.

            3     Q.  Do you consider that authoritative?

            4     A.  Yes.

            5     Q.  Is that something that you reviewed and relied upon in

            6     reaching your conclusions in this case?

            7     A.  Yes.

            8               MS. CONLIN:  Your Honor, we would offer

            9     Plaintiffs' Exhibit 94 under 803(18).

           10               THE COURT:  Received.

           11     BY MS. CONLIN:

           12     Q.  Tell us a little bit about what this article is about

           13     or this study is about, Dr. Jarvis?

           14     A.  Well, this is a study where they wanted to see if the

           15     Bair Hugger forced air warmer would interfere with the

           16     unidirectional airflow.  So a forced warming device was

           17     compared with another type of device, a radiant warming

           18     device or no warming device whatsoever, and they looked at

           19     two factors.

           20               One was, does it change the temperature because

           21     we know you can get convective currents with heat, and then

           22     second was, does it increase the particles?

           23     Q.  Okay.  And if we could take a look at under page two of

           24     this study under results, and if you could read the first

           25     paragraph to the jury and explain to them the import, if


                                  
                                        
                                                                             611



            1     any, any on your opinions?

            2     A.  "The temperature over the surgical site increased

            3     significantly when the forced air warming device was used

            4     in comparison to the radiant warming device or control,"

            5     which was no device.

            6     Q.  And if you can look at the next page and read the

            7     second conclusion in at the top of page 3?

            8     A.  "The number of particles over the surgical site was

            9     significantly higher when the forced air warming device was

           10     used in comparison to the radiant warming device or

           11     control."

           12     Q.  Okay.  And is that consistent with the other literature

           13     that you reviewed?

           14     A.  Yes.

           15     Q.  Okay.

           16               Your Honor, we would request publication of

           17     table -- well, let me ask a foundational question.

           18               Would publishing Table II help explain how you

           19     agree with this study?

           20     A.  Yes.

           21               MS. CONLIN:  I would ask for a publication of

           22     Table II, Your Honor.

           23               THE COURT:  Go ahead and show it.

           24     BY MS. CONLIN:

           25     Q.  So looks like a lot of numbers, Dr. Jarvis.  What are


                                  
                                        
                                                                             612



            1     we seeing here?

            2     A.  If you look at the far left-hand side where it says

            3     particle size, they're looking at three different particle

            4     sizes:  3 microns, .5 microns and 5 microns.  Then they

            5     look at the mean number of particles, and they're kind of

            6     falling into three categories.

            7               One is with the forced air warmer.  The second is

            8     with no warming, so no warming device at all, and the third

            9     is when the radiant device was used.  What is important is,

           10     when you look at the number of particles in the forced air

           11     with .3 microns you have 1,038 particles.  When there is no

           12     warming, you have about 20 percent of that, 278 -- 274 or

           13     '75, and radiant is basically the same as having no warming

           14     at all.

           15               And on the far right is, is it statistically

           16     significant?  Is the number with forced air warming

           17     significantly more than with the other one or two devices,

           18     and the answer is yes.  At the .0087, so very highly

           19     statistically significant.  It doesn't matter if you look

           20     at .3 micron particles, the very tiny ones; 5 microns,

           21     which are a little bit bigger; or 5, which are quite a bit

           22     bigger, regardless, you have over multiples of the number

           23     of particles that are in the air over the surgical site

           24     when you have forced air versus radiant heat or no device

           25     whatever, and they're all highly statistically significant.


                                  
                                        
                                                                             613



            1     Q.  Okay.  If I can direct your attention, Dr. Jarvis, to

            2     Plaintiffs' Exhibit 96, and if you could read that title

            3     for the Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury?

            4     A.  Evaluation of Bacterial Contamination on Surgical

            5     Drapes Following Use of the Bair Hugger --

            6     Q.  No.  No.  Nope.  Plaintiffs' Exhibit 96?

            7     A.  96?  Forced Air Warming Blanket Disrupts Unidirectional

            8     Airflow.

            9     Q.  Okay.  Is this another study by -- well, at least two

           10     of the authors are the same, published in the Bone and

           11     Joint Journal, correct?

           12     A.  Correct.  This is Bone and Joint Journal by Legg and

           13     colleagues, yes.

           14     Q.  Okay.  And you already indicated you think this is

           15     authoritative.  Did you review this and rely on this in

           16     connection with forming your opinions in this case?

           17     A.  Yes.

           18     Q.  Okay.

           19               We would offer Plaintiffs' Exhibit 96 under

           20     803(18).

           21               MR. COREY GORDON:  No objection, Your Honor.

           22               THE COURT:  Received.  Received.

           23     BY MS. CONLIN:

           24     Q.  So if we can look at page 3 of this study, Dr. Jarvis?

           25     A.  Okay.


                                  
                                        
                                                                             614



            1     Q.  And I would like to direct your attention to the

            2     portion of the article entitled Particle Entrainment.

            3     A.  Okay.

            4     Q.  And if you could just read that sentence to the Ladies

            5     and Gentlemen of the Jury and then explain it in English?

            6     A.  "Forced air warming significantly increased the

            7     concentrations of particles over the surgical site,

            8     2,174,000 per meter cubed compared with both the radiant

            9     warming device, where there were 1,000 particles per meter

           10     cubed, and that was highly statistically significant, P

           11     equals .0002 and the control."

           12     Q.  Okay.  What does that mean?

           13     A.  Well, it means that if you looked at the number of

           14     particles over the surgical site when you had the forced

           15     warming device versus radiant warming or the control, you

           16     had over 1,000 times the number of particles.

           17     Q.  Okay.  I would like to direct your attention to

           18     Plaintiffs' Exhibit 75, please.

           19     A.  Okay.

           20     Q.  And I think the Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury have

           21     heard a little bit about the Sessler study.  Can you read

           22     the title for the Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury?

           23     A.  Forced Air Warming Does Not Worsen Air Quality in

           24     Laminar Flow Operating Rooms.

           25     Q.  Okay.  And who was the lead author on this?


                                  
                                        
                                                                             615



            1     A.  Daniel Sessler.

            2     Q.  And based on your review of the record, was he a

            3     consultant to 3M?

            4     A.  Yes.

            5     Q.  Okay.  And the article is entitled Forced Air Warming

            6     Does Not Worsen Air Quality in Laminar Flow Operating

            7     Rooms.  Why is that not a counter to what you just said

            8     about all the studies showing that when the Bair Hugger is

            9     used, the number of particulates over the surgical site is

           10     significantly increased?

           11     A.  Well, because of the way they decided to reach their

           12     conclusion.

           13     Q.  What do you mean by that?

           14     A.  Well, they use the Bair Hugger with no air on versus

           15     ambient air versus warm air, and then with their assessment

           16     compared the ambient air to the warm air.  Well, the Bair

           17     Hugger is on with ambient air, and the Bair Hugger is on

           18     with warm air.  The difference is heat, not how much air is

           19     blowing.

           20               The same amount of air is blowing.  So it would

           21     make more sense to compare them to no air rather than

           22     ambient.

           23     Q.  Okay.  And have you reviewed -- we have heard from

           24     Dr. Kurz.  Did you review Dr. Sessler's deposition in this

           25     matter?


                                  
                                        
                                                                             616



            1     A.  Yes.

            2     Q.  What did he say the increased percentage was when the

            3     Bair Hugger was used?

            4     A.  I believe he said it was like 100 times.  I don't

            5     remember that number.

            6     Q.  Okay.

            7               MR. COREY GORDON:  Objection, Your Honor.

            8     Hearsay and lack of foundation.  Move to strike.

            9               THE COURT:  He doesn't remember so --

           10               MS. CONLIN:  That's fine.

           11               THE COURT:  We don't need to strike, I don't

           12     think.

           13     BY MS. CONLIN:

           14     Q.  Did anything in reviewing Dr. Sessler's deposition

           15     change your view that when the Bair Hugger is used, there

           16     is an increase of particulates over the surgical site?

           17     A.  No.

           18     Q.  Okay.  I would like to direct your attention to

           19     Plaintiffs' Exhibit 27.

           20     A.  Okay.

           21     Q.  Which should be the Stocks article; is that correct?

           22     A.  Yes, ma'am.

           23     Q.  What is the title of this article?

           24     A.  Predicting Bacteria Populations Based on Airborne

           25     Particles, a Study Performed in Nonlaminar Flow Operating


                                  
                                        
                                                                             617



            1     Rooms During Joint Arthroplasty Surgery.

            2     Q.  Okay.  And where was this published?

            3     A.  The Journal of the Association for Professionals in

            4     Infection Control and Epidemiology.

            5     Q.  Okay.  And you consider this authoritative?

            6     A.  Yes.

            7     Q.  Did you review and rely upon it in connection with the

            8     opinions that you've rendered in this case?

            9     A.  Yes.

           10               MS. CONLIN:  We would offer Plaintiffs'

           11     Exhibit 27 under 803(18).

           12               MR. COREY GORDON:  No objection on that grounds.

           13               THE COURT:  Received.

           14     BY MS. CONLIN:

           15     Q.  Actually, before we go to this, Doctor, let me back up

           16     and go to the Sessler -- the Sessler, I forgot to ask you a

           17     question on that.

           18               So that was a study -- I think if you need to

           19     look at it, it's 75, Doctor.

           20     A.  Okay.

           21     Q.  So that was a study conducted over in the Netherlands;

           22     is that right?

           23     A.  Correct.

           24     Q.  Okay.  And they have a standard in the Netherlands

           25     called DIN.  What's that?


                                  
                                        
                                                                             618



            1     A.  I believe it is a standard for devices that are brought

            2     into the operating room to assess the relative impact on

            3     the laminar airflow.

            4     Q.  In the Sessler study they were looking at whether you

            5     could still meet the DIN standard and use the Bair Hugger?

            6     A.  Correct.

            7     Q.  Is that different than whether the use of the Bair

            8     Hugger in that study increased the number of particles over

            9     the surgical site?

           10     A.  Totally.  Two different issues.

           11     Q.  Okay.  So turning back to the Stocks article,

           12     Plaintiffs' Exhibit 27, what was the purpose of this study?

           13     If you could just describe a little bit for the Ladies and

           14     Gentlemen of the Jury, and then we'll get to the conclusion

           15     why you think it's important.

           16     A.  Well, they looked at 22 joint arthroplasty procedures

           17     and used an impact sampler to sample the air and used

           18     culture plates to determine colony-forming units, and they

           19     wanted to see was there an increase in particulates and/or

           20     colony-forming units when the forced air warmer Bair Hugger

           21     was used.

           22     Q.  Okay.  And what did they conclude?

           23     A.  They found that particle counts and CFUs increased and

           24     that there was a correlation between certain particle sizes

           25     and bacterial contamination.


                                  
                                        
                                                                             619



            1     Q.  Okay.  I think you got this confused with another

            2     study, Dr. Jarvis.  I don't believe that the Bair Hugger

            3     was used in that study.

            4               Can you take a look at that and just confirm that

            5     for me?

            6               MR. COREY GORDON:  Your Honor, I move to strike

            7     his testimony.

            8               THE COURT:  Well, I think we're going to

            9     establish that it was wrong.

           10               MS. CONLIN:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.

           11               THE WITNESS:  Okay.  You're correct.

           12     BY MS. CONLIN:

           13     Q.  Yeah.

           14     A.  It's just the 22 arthroplasty procedures.

           15     Q.  You've looked at hundreds of studies, correct, Doctor?

           16     A.  Correct.

           17     Q.  And so I would like to direct your attention to the

           18     conclusion of this study at page 5.

           19     A.  Okay.

           20     Q.  And if you could read that to the Ladies and Gentlemen

           21     of the Jury and explain what relevance, if any, that had to

           22     the conclusions that you reached in this case as it relates

           23     to particulates and bacteria?

           24     A.  The last paragraph?

           25     Q.  Yes.


                                  
                                        
                                                                             620



            1     A.  "We found that the number of airborne particulates

            2     equal to or greater 10 microns was correlated with the

            3     number of CFUs grown from air sampled within the sterile

            4     field approximately 40 centimeters from the surgical

            5     incision."

            6     Q.  Okay.  And what relevance, if any, does that conclusion

            7     from the Stocks study have on your opinions in this case?

            8     A.  It shows that there is -- some studies just look at

            9     particulates.  Others have looked at CFUs.  This one is

           10     trying to look at, is there a correlation between the two

           11     and found that there was.

           12               One of the big issues that has come up within

           13     this area of study is that if you ask me how many bacteria

           14     are over the surgical field during a procedure, say

           15     Mr. Gareis's procedure, I would have to be there for that

           16     procedure, and then I would have to do culture plates or

           17     air sampling, and then I would have to send it to the

           18     microbiology laboratory and wait for three to five days,

           19     and then I would get an answer.

           20               Whereas if I were doing particle counts, I could

           21     get you an answer in the middle of his procedure.  At any

           22     time during his procedure I could tell you what the

           23     particle count is because it's a continuous measurement,

           24     and it gives you a result right away.

           25               So many of the researchers have been trying to


                                  
                                        
                                                                             621



            1     find a way of getting a quick snapshot of what is going on

            2     and what the risk might be, and this paper shows in this

            3     study using this methodology that they were able to see

            4     there was a correlation between the particle counts and the

            5     CFU or bacterial contamination.

            6     Q.  And the Sessler article that we just looked at, was

            7     that looking at particulates or bacteria?

            8     A.  Particulates.

            9     Q.  Okay.  Then I would like to direct your attention to

           10     Figure 1 in this study, same study.  It's on 27, page 4.

           11     A.  Yes.

           12     Q.  Would publishing that figure assist in describing your

           13     conclusions and relevance to this article as it relates to

           14     the opinions you've rendered in this case?

           15     A.  Yes.

           16               MS. CONLIN:  I would request permission to

           17     publish Figure 1 of Plaintiffs' Exhibit 27.

           18               MR. COREY GORDON:  No objections, Your Honor.

           19               THE COURT:  Go ahead.

           20     BY MS. CONLIN:

           21     Q.  Can you explain for the Ladies and Gentlemen of the

           22     Jury what we're seeing here, maybe first on the Y and Z

           23     access and then explain what it is?

           24     A.  Yeah.  This is, again, somewhat similar to what we saw

           25     with the Darouiche paper.  On the left-hand side is the


                                  
                                        
                                                                             622



            1     colony-forming units for meter squared, so how many

            2     bacteria are there in the air that we're sampling per meter

            3     squared.

            4               And then on the lateral axis is how many 10

            5     micron particles are there per meter squared, and each of

            6     those dots is a result from this study, and then the solid

            7     line is what is called the correlation coefficient.

            8     They're looking at is there a correlation between the

            9     particulate density and the colony-forming units density,

           10     and they find that there is, and then the two dotted lines

           11     are the 95 percent confidence intervals.

           12     Q.  Okay.  Thank you.

           13               We heard a bit today about the international

           14     consensus.  Do you recall that?

           15     A.  Yes.

           16     Q.  And I think that consensus report was from 2014,

           17     correct?

           18     A.  I believe that was the date.

           19     Q.  Okay.  Now, you, did you review the reports of

           20     Dr. Elghobashi in connection with your opinions in this

           21     case?

           22     A.  Yes.

           23     Q.  And do you know when Dr. Elghobashi performed his

           24     computational fluid dynamics modeling that the jury will be

           25     hearing about next week?


                                  
                                        
                                                                             623



            1     A.  I believe around 2016, 2017.

            2     Q.  Okay.  So that would have been a couple years after the

            3     international consensus, correct?

            4     A.  Correct.

            5     Q.  Okay.  I'm not going to drag you through CFD modeling.

            6     Dr. Elghobashi will describe it, but I would like to

            7     publish Plaintiffs' Trial Exhibit 1607, slide 12.

            8               MR. COREY GORDON:  Objection, Your Honor.  No

            9     foundation.  It's not authenticated.

           10               THE COURT:  There is not enough foundation yet.

           11     You might think you asked a question that you didn't.

           12     BY MS. CONLIN:

           13     Q.  Okay.  So you reviewed Dr. Elghobashi's analysis,

           14     correct, Doctor?

           15     A.  Correct.

           16     Q.  And you reviewed the figures and drawings, correct?

           17     A.  Correct.

           18     Q.  Okay.  And would they, would that CFD modeling or a

           19     snapshot of it help explain your opinions to the jury and

           20     how you relied on them?

           21     A.  Yes.

           22               MS. CONLIN:  We would offer --

           23               THE COURT:  It is 12.  Ask him if he knows what

           24     12 is.

           25


                                  
                                        
                                                                             624



            1     BY MS. CONLIN:

            2     Q.  Do you know what 1607, page 12 is?

            3     A.  Yes.  This is a snapshot of his computational fluid

            4     model looking at air particles.

            5               THE COURT:  Okay.  All right.

            6               MR. COREY GORDON:  Your Honor, now I object on

            7     Rule 403 and 701.

            8               THE COURT:  Objection is overruled.  Go ahead.

            9               MS. CONLIN:  Thank you.

           10     BY MS. CONLIN:

           11     Q.  And this is just a snapshot from Dr. Elghobashi's

           12     modeling with connection with the 505, is that right,

           13     Doctor?

           14     A.  Correct.

           15     Q.  And how did this modeling and the analysis done by

           16     Dr. Elghobashi impact the opinions that you rendered in

           17     this case with respect to the Bair Hugger?

           18     A.  I think several ways.  One is that we have been talking

           19     about particles.  We have been talking about CFUs and the

           20     impact that excess heat from the Bair Hugger would have on

           21     those, but we have kind of little pieces of the puzzle, and

           22     this helps to bring it all together and give a visual of

           23     what we're talking about, that as that heat is released, it

           24     has an impact on those particles and the bacteria that are

           25     on some of those particles that are on below the operating


                                  
                                        
                                                                             625



            1     room table and what does it do to those, and it gives us a

            2     visual of what it's doing to those.

            3     Q.  Okay.  Did you also review the report or the McGovern

            4     study?

            5     A.  Yes.

            6     Q.  Okay.  And we're going to talk about that a little bit.

            7     You understand that Dr. Samet is coming next week on that,

            8     but I just want you to briefly touch upon why you thought

            9     that study was important to the opinions that you're

           10     reaching here.

           11               So if I could direct your attention to

           12     Plaintiffs' Trial Exhibit 93.

           13               MR. COREY GORDON:  Your Honor, we want to note

           14     our objections under 402 and 403 and MIL 1.

           15               THE COURT:  You may proceed.

           16               MS. CONLIN:  Thank you.

           17     BY MS. CONLIN:

           18     Q.  Do you have it, Doctor.

           19     A.  Yes, ma'am.

           20     Q.  This is known as the McGovern study; is that right?

           21     A.  Correct.

           22     Q.  And it was published in the Journal of Bone and Joint

           23     Surgery, correct?

           24     A.  Yes.

           25     Q.  Okay.  And it was authored by Dr. McGovern from the UK,


                                  
                                        
                                                                             626



            1     correct?

            2     A.  Correct.

            3     Q.  And then there were also some individuals from

            4     Minnesota, including Mr. Albrecht and Dr. Belani and

            5     Dr. Nachtsheim, correct?

            6     A.  Correct.

            7     Q.  Okay.  And was this a study that was comparing

            8     surgical -- I'm sorry -- deep joint infections or PJIs or

            9     DJIs, you consider those interchangeable, right?

           10     A.  Correct.

           11     Q.  Comparing the infection rate when a Bair Hugger was

           12     used versus a different warming modality; is that right?

           13     A.  That was one part of the study, yes.

           14     Q.  Okay.  And I would like to direct your attention to the

           15     discussion which is on page 5.

           16     A.  Okay.

           17     Q.  And if you could just read the first sentence and what

           18     impact, if any, that sentence had to you in connection with

           19     your conclusions in this case?

           20     A.  "Forced air warming was found to have a significant and

           21     disruptive impact on the clean airflow patterns over the

           22     surgical site compared to conductive fabric warming which

           23     had no detectable effect."

           24     Q.  Okay.  And did the McGovern authors also look at

           25     whether you got more infections if you used the Bair Hugger


                                  
                                        
                                                                             627



            1     versus some other way of warming?

            2     A.  Yes.

            3     Q.  Okay.  And what did those authors find?

            4     A.  That the risk of an infection was increased by a factor

            5     of 3.8 over the other warming system.  Odds ratio was 3.8.

            6     Q.  What is -- Dr. Samet is going to talk about this next

            7     week, but the way I think about it from a lay person

            8     standpoint, does that mean you have a 380 --

            9               THE COURT:  Use the microphone.

           10               MS. CONLIN:  Sorry, Your Honor.  Sorry.

           11     BY MS. CONLIN:

           12     Q.  -- 380 increase or times increased risk, or how would

           13     you describe an odds risk ratio of 3.8 to those of us who

           14     are not epidemiologists?

           15     A.  You have a 380 times greater risk of having an

           16     infection.

           17     Q.  And if I could direct your attention to page 7 of

           18     Plaintiffs' Exhibit 93.

           19     A.  Okay.

           20     Q.  And I would like you to look at the first full

           21     paragraph there after they talk about this 3.8 increased

           22     risk, and it says, "This study does not establish a causal

           23     basis for this association."

           24               What does that mean?

           25     A.  Well, I think they realize that, you know, it's not a


                                  
                                        
                                                                             628



            1     huge number of patients, and it's very difficult in most

            2     studies to show a causal relationship.

            3     Q.  Okay.  Is that language that you see often?

            4     A.  Very often, yes.

            5     Q.  Okay.  And what does it mean that there is an

            6     association versus causal basis?

            7     A.  Well, association means that they've obviously found a

            8     statistical association and that what they can't say is it

            9     is the only cause.

           10     Q.  Okay.  And so is it -- and was this a randomized

           11     control trial?

           12     A.  No.

           13     Q.  It was an observational study?

           14     A.  Correct.

           15     Q.  And what import does that difference have to someone

           16     such as yourself?

           17     A.  Well, theoretically randomized control trial, as we

           18     mentioned, that controls for confounding variables is, can

           19     be the best type of study.  That's not to say that some

           20     randomized control trials aren't faulty as well, but

           21     observational studies tend to be, tend to suffer more from

           22     the, that confounding variables issue and that unless you

           23     collect an enormous amount of data so you can kind of --

           24     and have a large number of patients so you can analyze all

           25     those little tiny cells, you can't necessarily control for


                                  
                                        
                                                                             629



            1     all those different confounding variables.

            2               So they're not as powerful a study, but they, to

            3     me before/after studies, as well as case control and cohort

            4     studies that are less powerful than a randomized control

            5     trial, but most of the time in epidemiology what you find

            6     is, if you find it in a well designed observational case

            7     control or cohort study and you subsequently do a huge

            8     randomized control study, you find the same thing.

            9     Q.  So we have kind of put together a bunch of pieces of

           10     the puzzle, and I would kind of like to summarize it before

           11     we get to Mr. Gareis.

           12               Have you had a demonstrative prepared that would

           13     aid the Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury in understanding

           14     how you put these pieces together?

           15     A.  Yes.

           16               MS. CONLIN:  Your Honor, we would offer for

           17     demonstrative purposes 1607, slide 16.

           18               THE COURT:  Has it been amended since yesterday?

           19               MS. CONLIN:  It has, Your Honor.

           20               THE COURT:  Okay.

           21               MR. COREY GORDON:  13?

           22               MS. CONLIN:  16.

           23               MR. COREY GORDON:  I apologize.  No objection,

           24     Your Honor.

                                                                             630



            1     BY MS. CONLIN:

            2     Q.  So explain, we have kind of gone through all these

            3     different pieces.  Explain sort of how these all wrap up in

            4     connection with your opinion that the use of a Bair Hugger

            5     increases the likelihood that you're going to get a PJI?

            6     A.  I think what we find in clinical medicine is, advances

            7     are made kind of a step at a time, and we know the first

            8     one.  Bacteria cause infection.  Micro organism cause

            9     infection.  If you don't have the micro organism, you're

           10     not going to get an infection, period.

           11               We also know now from a variety of both human

           12     studies and animal studies that a smaller inoculum of

           13     bacteria will cause an implant infection or a prosthetic

           14     joint infection or a PJI, compared to trying to

           15     experimentally cause an infection with bugs without an

           16     implant takes thousands, if not tens or hundreds of

           17     thousands, more organisms.

           18               We know, Darouiche study shows it eloquently,

           19     that airborne contamination can cause a PJI.  We know the

           20     environment of use of any device is very important.  If I

           21     have a device that produces 50 percent infection rates, but

           22     this is the operating room, and I have it outside the

           23     operating room, who cares?

           24               If I bring it into the operating room, you're

           25     going to care.  We know multiple studies have shown that


                                  
                                        
                                                                             631



            1     the Bair Hugger increases particles over the surgical

            2     field.  We know that increased particles causes increased

            3     bacteria.  Stocks just showed the combination, correlation

            4     between the two, and that increased bacteria causes

            5     increased risk for a prosthetic joint infection.

            6               So we have a variety of studies that answer each

            7     one of these questions, and when you put them all together,

            8     you get a picture similar to what Dr. Elghobashi has shown

            9     with his CFD model that illustrates why the Bair Hugger

           10     will increase the risk of prosthetic joint infections.

           11     Q.  Okay.  Now, you were here during opening, and you heard

           12     Mr. Blackwell say that the Bair Hugger was safe because of

           13     studies, correct?

           14     A.  Correct.

           15     Q.  I think he said the most studied forced air warming

           16     device in the history of the planet.  Do you recall that?

           17     A.  Yes.

           18     Q.  Okay.  Have you looked at the studies that 3M has

           19     relied upon for its position that the Bair Hugger is safe?

           20     A.  Yes.

           21     Q.  Okay.  I would like to direct your attention to

           22     Plaintiffs' Trial Exhibit 1, the Zink study.

           23     A.  Yes.

           24     Q.  And is that one of the studies that 3M has relied upon?

           25     A.  Yes.


                                  
                                        
                                                                             632



            1     Q.  Can you describe for the Ladies and Gentlemen of the

            2     Jury what this study was about?

            3     A.  This study involved eight healthy volunteers.

            4     Q.  Let me stop you right there.  There was only eight

            5     volunteers in the Zink study?

            6     A.  Yes, eight volunteers, 20 to 25 years of age.  Not

            7     exactly our age, Mr. Gareis, and they then took them into

            8     an operating room and had them lay on a table.  And then

            9     they used a lower body warming device.

           10               So Mr. Gareis's was an upper body.  They're using

           11     a lower body.  They placed a sterile drape, and then they

           12     did testing during two hours when it was off and two hours

           13     when it was on using culture plates that they set on their

           14     abdomen.

           15     Q.  And what was the date of the study?

           16     A.  The date of the --

           17     Q.  Or the date of the publication?

           18     A.  This is from 1993.

           19     Q.  Okay.

           20               THE COURT:  That was leading.

           21               MS. CONLIN:  It was, Your Honor.  I apologize.

           22     BY MS. CONLIN:

           23     Q.  Do you know what the date of the study was, Dr. Jarvis?

           24     A.  Yeah.  I'm trying to see if there was a month, but it's

           25     1993.


                                  
                                        
                                                                             633



            1     Q.  Thank you.  And so I think you said it was not, not

            2     conducted under actual surgical conditions?

            3     A.  Correct.

            4     Q.  All right.  I would like to talk to you about the Huang

            5     study, Plaintiffs' Exhibit 215.

            6     A.  Okay.

            7     Q.  What was the date of that study, Doctor?

            8     A.  Published March 4, 2003.

            9     Q.  Okay.  And how many patients were in that study?

           10     A.  Let me make sure.  The reason I'm pausing is, it's

           11     interesting that their methods on the front page and their

           12     results give different answers to that question.

           13               The methods say that they studied 16 patients

           14     undergoing abdominal vascular prosthetic graft insertion.

           15     Q.  What kind of surgery is that?

           16     A.  It's abdominal surgery that Mr. Gareis did not have.

           17     Q.  Okay.  Is there an implant involved in that?

           18     A.  It's a prosthetic graph, but it's certainly a different

           19     type of prosthesis than you would see with a prosthetic

           20     joint implant.

           21     Q.  Okay.  And if I could have you also look at the Moretti

           22     study, Plaintiffs' Exhibit 727, and what's the date of that

           23     study when you get there?

           24     A.  77?

           25     Q.  727.


                                  
                                        
                                                                             634



            1     A.  Oh, 727.  That was available online July 31st, 2009.

            2     Q.  Okay.  And how many patients were in that study?

            3     A.  Well, there were 30 patients in the study, but 20 in

            4     which Bair Hugger was used.

            5     Q.  Okay.  And as long as we're on Moretti, this was

            6     published in the Journal of Hospital Infection; is that

            7     right?

            8     A.  Correct.

            9     Q.  Okay.  And do you consider that authoritative?

           10     A.  Yes.

           11     Q.  And is this something that you reviewed and relied upon

           12     in connection with your opinions in this case?

           13     A.  Yes.

           14     Q.  Okay.  If I could direct your attention, Doctor, to

           15     page 3.

           16     A.  Okay.

           17     Q.  And if you could look at the second paragraph under the

           18     results.

           19     A.  Yes.

           20     Q.  And if you could read that to the Ladies and Gentlemen

           21     of the Jury, please, starting with, "In the 20"?

           22     A.  "In the 20 procedures in which the Bair Hugger was

           23     used, the mean bacterial load values were significantly

           24     increased in the three points compared with the at rest

           25     conditions."


                                  
                                        
                                                                             635



            1     Q.  And what does that mean?

            2     A.  I think they compared it with the Bair Hugger on versus

            3     the Bair Hugger off.  Let me check the methods and make

            4     sure.

            5     Q.  And finally, I would like to direct your attention to

            6     the --

            7               Did you have something you wanted to add on

            8     Moretti, Doctor?

            9     A.  I was going to say the control is with no Bair Hugger,

           10     so their at rest is presumably either with the Bair Hugger

           11     off or when the Bair Hugger is not there at all.

           12     Q.  Okay.  Thank you.  Now I would like to turn your

           13     attention to Plaintiffs' Exhibit 771.

           14     A.  Okay.

           15     Q.  And this was the Hall paper that was referenced during

           16     opening statements, correct?

           17     A.  Correct.

           18     Q.  Okay.  And what type of publication was this?

           19     A.  It's actually not a peer reviewed publication.  This is

           20     a poster that was submitted to a meeting.

           21     Q.  Okay.  And what were they doing in that study, the Hall

           22     study?

           23     A.  They had 20 adults who were undergoing oral or

           24     maxillofacial surgery, again not prosthetic joint implant.

           25     Q.  And what was the date of this?


                                  
                                        
                                                                             636



            1     A.  Well, it's written at the top, it's not otherwise on

            2     the document, that it was December 9, 1991.

            3     Q.  Okay.  So if I --

            4     A.  So it should have been published by now.

            5     Q.  If I add all those up, how many patients were involved

            6     in these studies that 3M is relying upon in this case?

            7     A.  64 patients.

            8     Q.  Okay.  How does that contrast with, for example, with

            9     the Darouiche or the McGovern studies?

           10     A.  Much less, and none of them are randomized control

           11     trials.

           12     Q.  All right.  I would like to turn your attention, then,

           13     to Mr. Gareis, to specific causation.  Have you reviewed

           14     Mr. Gareis's medical records and the testimony from the

           15     treating physicians and personnel at Providence Hospital?

           16     A.  Yes, ma'am.

           17     Q.  Okay.  And based on what you have testified to already

           18     and based on your review of the particular facts of

           19     Mr. Gareis's case, have you reached a conclusion to a

           20     reasonable degree of medical certainty as to the cause of

           21     Mr. Gareis's infection?

           22     A.  Yes.

           23     Q.  And what is that, Doctor?

           24     A.  That the Bair Hugger was responsible for his infection.

           25     Q.  Okay.  Can you describe the methodology that you


                                  
                                        
                                                                             637



            1     employed in arriving at that conclusion?

            2     A.  As we discussed before, I was reviewing his medical

            3     record, reviewing all the available literature that

            4     addresses this issue, looking at the reports of experts on

            5     both sides, looking at the references used by those

            6     individuals and looking at the depositions, as well as some

            7     3M materials.

            8     Q.  Okay.  Is there a particular name for this type of

            9     analysis on this?

           10     A.  Some would call it similar to a clinical differential

           11     diagnosis.

           12     Q.  Okay.

           13     A.  Differential etiology.

           14     Q.  Okay.  If we could put up, put up 1607, slide 37,

           15     differential diagnosis.

           16               Okay.  And explain for the Ladies and Gentlemen

           17     of the Jury what a differential diagnosis is?

           18     A.  If you were to look at an individual patient, for

           19     instance, they come in with a constellation of signs and

           20     symptoms, and you would do a variety of different, say,

           21     blood tests, radiologic tests, physical examination.  And

           22     then based upon that, you would come up with a differential

           23     diagnosis of what are the most common, what are the most

           24     likely, what are not likely and what should be ruled out.

           25     Q.  Okay.  And what is the standard of proof that you


                                  
                                        
                                                                             638



            1     employed for the purposes of this differential diagnosis?

            2     A.  Well, it's my understanding that in instances like this

            3     that the bar that we have to meet is called more likely

            4     than not.

            5     Q.  Okay.

            6     A.  With more likely than not being, it's 51 percent or

            7     more.  So it excludes things like, well, there is a case

            8     report of one of this happening in the history of the earth

            9     or that tomorrow something could happen that has never

           10     happened before.

           11               You know, sure.  It's one in a million, one in

           12     ten million, one in ten zillion, but that's not more likely

           13     than not.  So looking at the evidence and coming up with

           14     what is more likely than not.

           15     Q.  Okay.  So you looked at it and said what's most likely

           16     versus what you need to rule out and what is unlikely, is

           17     that right, Doctor?

           18     A.  Correct.

           19     Q.  Okay.  I would like to talk to you about some of the

           20     specifics as it relates to your opinion with Mr. Gareis.

           21               And for the record, this is slide 20 of

           22     Plaintiffs' Exhibit 1607, Your Honor, which we will offer

           23     for demonstrative purposes.

           24               MR. COREY GORDON:  Your Honor, I object to

           25     publishing this until he has testified about it.


                                  
                                        
                                                                             639



            1               THE COURT:  Oh, have you seen it already, Doctor?

            2               THE WITNESS:  Excuse me?

            3               THE COURT:  Go ahead.

            4               MS. CONLIN:  I'm sorry.  I didn't realize, Your

            5     Honor.

            6               THE COURT:  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go

            7     ahead.

            8     BY MS. CONLIN:

            9     Q.  We've got here reducing the risk of infection.  Did you

           10     look at risk factors as it relates to Mr. Gareis --

           11     A.  Absolutely.

           12     Q.  -- specifically?  Okay.  And let's talk first about

           13     preoperative shaving.  Was that done?

           14     A.  No.  We know that preoperative shaving if done can nick

           15     the skin and increase the risk for at least one of those

           16     superficial incisional infections, and he did not have any

           17     shaving done.

           18     Q.  Okay.  Did he have elevated glucose?  We heard

           19     testimony about Mr. Gareis being mildly diabetic.

           20     A.  Correct.  In a variety of studies looking at prosthetic

           21     joint infections, some studies have identified diabetes as

           22     a risk factors.  Some of those studies have looked at

           23     glucose levels being very high or very low or being on

           24     insulin or not being on insulin.

           25               So rather than saying every diabetic is the same


                                  
                                        
                                                                             640



            1     risk, and that's not the case.  In Mr. Gareis's case, he

            2     had a hemoglobin a1c that basically has categories that say

            3     you're diabetic or not, and he was actually just below the

            4     diagnosis of diabetes, but he is on oral medications to

            5     control his blood glucose.

            6               If you look at his blood glucose during his

            7     entire surgical time in the hospital, he never had a value

            8     above 150.  He had one that was 150.  The others were all

            9     below 125, and 100, 125 is where you like to have patients

           10     below if they are having a surgical procedure.  So I don't

           11     think there is much evidence to suggest that his diabetes

           12     was out of control and placed him at increased risk for

           13     infection.

           14     Q.  If you are at increased risk, can you get an infection

           15     without a bug landing there?

           16     A.  No.

           17     Q.  Okay.  One of the things I noticed we forgot to put on

           18     here, Doctor, was obesity.  Was Mr. Gareis considered obese

           19     under BMI?

           20     A.  Yeah.  It's interesting.  He has a BMI of 34 point, I

           21     think it was 9 or 7, very close to 35, which is considered

           22     obese, but I think if you look at Mr. Gareis, he strikes me

           23     more as like a football player.  He is big.  He is not --

           24               My wife would say I'm not exactly obese, but I'm

           25     not in as good shape as I would say Mr. Gareis is.  So I


                                  
                                        
                                                                             641



            1     think his definition of obesity, he's very close to being

            2     by BMI obese, but he is certainly not the obese that I

            3     would think of as being a risk for surgical site infection

            4     where you have fat hanging over your incisional site.

            5     Q.  Okay.  What about patient's skin, Mr. Gareis's skin?

            6     A.  Well, as we mentioned from the Darouiche study, the

            7     patient's skin is certainly, organisms on that skin can be

            8     pathogens causing incisional infections for sure, but if

            9     you look at his history before his surgery, he had

           10     Hibiclens bath the night before surgery, Hibiclens bath the

           11     night of surgery.

           12               He had alcohol prep, as Dr. Presnal says, and

           13     then ChloraPrep, which is a combination of two agents:

           14     Chlorhexidine and alcohol.  So when you think about it, he

           15     had literally four skin preps, any one of which would have

           16     decreased his transient flora, which is what we're trying

           17     to get rid of.

           18               When we do hand hygiene, we're trying to get rid

           19     of the bugs that are superficial on your hands, not the

           20     ones that are deep down with the bacteria because they're

           21     not going to jump off and go anywhere.

           22               Each of those agents would reduce that transient

           23     bacteria by at least 80 percent.  If you think about it, 80

           24     percent, another 80 percent, another 80 percent, another 80

           25     percent.  So the likelihood he had a number of large


                                  
                                        
                                                                             642



            1     transient organisms that were sitting there waiting to jump

            2     into the operative field is pretty low.

            3     Q.  We also heard testimony by Dr. Presnal about Ioban.

            4     Did you bring a photo of that?

            5     A.  Ioban ban is basically --

            6               MS. CONLIN:  Hang on one second, Your Honor.  We

            7     offer slide 24 of Exhibit 1607 for demonstrative purposes.

            8               THE COURT:  Go ahead.

            9     BY MS. CONLIN:

           10     Q.  What are we seeing here?

           11     A.  So this is an example of Ioban when you see that orange

           12     color.  It is basically a plastic sheet that you put onto

           13     the patient, and it kind of sticks to the patient.  And

           14     that orange that you're seeing is on the patient's side of

           15     that material and is an iodine product.

           16               And iodine kills bacteria, and so the purpose of

           17     this is to keep that iodine in contact with the skin when

           18     you do the incision so that what we know with skin preps,

           19     alcohol kills organisms immediately.  So if I put it on

           20     here, it will kill those organisms immediately.  It dries

           21     and is done.

           22               The reason chlorhexidine is a wonderful product

           23     is because it binds to the skin.  It has residual activity.

           24     Alcohol, immediate, done.  Chlorhexidine is going to bind

           25     to the skin and releases over time, even afterwards, so you


                                  
                                        
                                                                             643



            1     get kill continuing even into the operative procedure.

            2     Q.  Did you --

            3     A.  And the same is true with this.  It doesn't allow the

            4     organisms that are on the edge of the skin that are having

            5     contact with this Ioban product to regrow.  So if you had a

            6     long procedure, say those colon procedures that are three

            7     or four hours, the organisms begin to grow back.

            8               And usually by 18 to 24 hours after applying a

            9     skin antiseptic or doing hand hygiene, the organisms are

           10     back to the level they were before.  So it helps to keep

           11     those organisms at very low levels.

           12     Q.  Did you see any evidence that Mr. Gareis suffered from

           13     a superficial wound infection?

           14     A.  None.

           15     Q.  Okay.

           16     A.  None.

           17     Q.  So let me just put back up this classifications of

           18     surgical site infection.

           19               Did you see any evidence in this case that

           20     perhaps the joint infection he ended up with started

           21     somewhere up in the subcutaneous tissue or the deep soft

           22     tissue and tunneled down?

           23     A.  No.  If you read Dr. Presnal's note, he describes it

           24     very well and points out that there is really literally no

           25     sign of infection until you get down to the prosthesis.


                                  
                                        
                                                                             644



            1     Q.  So let's go back to your risk factors.  We've talked

            2     about the skin flora, skin bugs, and you think that that

            3     was appropriately handled?

            4     A.  Absolutely.

            5     Q.  Okay.  How about healthcare worker skin shedding?  What

            6     did you see in connection with your review of the records

            7     with Dr. -- regarding Mr. Gareis?

            8     A.  Well, we heard in the opening papers how many

            9     millions -- Mr. Blackwell said one times ten to the

           10     ninth --

           11               THE COURT:  The comments about the opening

           12     statements aren't evidence, and so if you could just

           13     restrict your comments to your area of expertise.

           14               THE WITNESS:  Well, the large -- we know that

           15     large number of skin squames are released from each of us

           16     and certainly from healthcare workers as well, but I

           17     certainly want to dispel the idea that we need to have a

           18     shovel or a vacuum coming into the operating room to clean

           19     them all up after each case.  That's a bit absurd.

           20               And then in this case we know that Dr. Presnal,

           21     as well as the other healthcare workers, did hand hygiene.

           22     He talked about that beforehand.  He double gloved and

           23     changed gloves during the procedure.  He was wearing a gown

           24     and shoe covers and an exhaust hood basically over his head

           25     to make sure that his skin cells were not being released


                                  
                                        
                                                                             645



            1     into the operative field.

            2               So we really have no evidence, and in fact we

            3     have evidence to suggest that they were doing everything

            4     they could possibly do to reduce the risk of healthcare

            5     workers' skin squames causing infection.

            6     BY MS. CONLIN:

            7     Q.  How about antimicrobial prophylaxis?  What is that in

            8     lay terms?

            9     A.  The purpose of an antimicrobial prophylaxis is to give

           10     you an antibiotic, the right antibiotic given at the right

           11     time and in the right dose so that you will have a peak of

           12     that antibiotic in your tissues when I take that scalpel

           13     and start cutting, because we know that there are bacteria

           14     in the air, and that helps kill them if they land there.

           15               And Mr. Gareis received two grams of Ancef, which

           16     at that time was the recommended dose of prophylactic

           17     antibiotic in a patient of his weight, and he got it at the

           18     right time.

           19     Q.  You talked about the scalpel already, that Dr. Presnal

           20     did what?

           21     A.  He, in his videos, talked about how he did the skin

           22     incision, and then he discarded that scalpel and used a

           23     bovie most of the time or his hands or another scalpel.

           24     Q.  Okay.

           25     A.  So we have no evidence that he took the skin scalpel


                                  
                                        
                                                                             646



            1     and hen later used it with the implant.

            2     Q.  How about glove contamination?

            3     A.  He double gloved, and he changed his gloves

            4     periodically during the surgical procedure.

            5     Q.  Okay.  And how about the operating room traffic?  What

            6     did you understand about that?

            7     A.  Well, we know there weren't an excess number of

            8     healthcare workers in the operating room to begin with, and

            9     second, that he had two doors, one that went to a sterile

           10     hallway and went that went to a nonsterile hallway.

           11               He testified he put a sign on the nonsterile

           12     hallway and repeatedly educated and discouraged healthcare

           13     workers from coming in and out of the room and that they

           14     would primarily use the sterile hallway and wear their

           15     surgical gowns when they went in and out.

           16               And we know from the engineer that they had an

           17     excellent air system, including filtration, ultraviolet

           18     radiation and high frequency particulate filtration.

           19     Q.  Okay.

           20     A.  And that the operating room was in positive pressure

           21     compared to the outside rooms.  If you open the door, the

           22     air is going to go out, not come in.

           23     Q.  So you looked at all those, and did you rule those out?

           24     Rule those in?  How did you do it as it relates to the

           25     differential diagnosis?


                                  
                                        
                                                                             647



            1     A.  I think it rules all of those out for being major risk

            2     factors for Mr. Gareis's infection.

            3     Q.  Okay.  I would like to talk to you a little bit about

            4     the equipment in the OR.

            5               Your Honor, I understand that perhaps if I was

            6     going to put something on an easel, this corner would be

            7     okay over there?

            8               THE COURT:  I think that's good.

            9               MS. CONLIN:  Okay.  Thank you.

           10     BY MS. CONLIN:

           11     Q.  I'm going to put it on the easel for demonstrative

           12     purposes Plaintiffs' Exhibit demonstrative Exhibit 1608,

           13     and you've seen that before, Doctor?

           14     A.  Yes.

           15     Q.  Okay.  And this is some of the equipment in the OR that

           16     has been identified as potential sources in the OR,

           17     correct, Doctor?

           18     A.  It says common sources.

           19     Q.  Okay.  And I would like to talk to you about it,

           20     Doctor, in terms of what you ruled in and ruled out.  I

           21     think if we look at the upper right corner, what does that

           22     say there?

           23     A.  Far right up here (indicating)?

           24     Q.  Yep.

           25     A.  Glove perforations.


                                  
                                        
                                                                             648



            1     Q.  And we talked about that, right?

            2     A.  Yes.

            3     Q.  Did you rule that out?

            4     A.  Yes.

            5     Q.  Okay.  How about surgical instruments?

            6     A.  We have no evidence that any surgical instrument was

            7     either intrinsically or extrinsically contaminated.

            8     Q.  Okay.  And did you, based on your review of the

            9     testimony and the records, think that the techniques were

           10     proper?

           11     A.  Yes.

           12     Q.  What's the next one up there?

           13     A.  Electrocautery machine and other equipment.

           14     Q.  Okay.  And did you look at the possibility that other

           15     equipment in the OR could have caused the infection that

           16     Mr. Gareis suffered from?

           17     A.  Well, I think I put it into two categories.

           18     Electrocautery I can say that there were absolutely no

           19     reports in the literature that I could find of

           20     electrocautery being linked to a prosthetic joint

           21     infection.

           22     Q.  Okay.

           23     A.  And at least with electrocautery, the device, the bovie

           24     that Dr. Stonnington talked about, was actually in the

           25     operative field.  Most of the other equipment they're


                                  
                                        
                                                                             649



            1     talking about, computer, lights, et cetera, are not even in

            2     the operative field.

            3               So unless you take the patient and their joint

            4     and you move them over and rub them against it, I'm not

            5     sure how they're going to have an impact on causing a joint

            6     infection.

            7     Q.  We've also talked about the gown and drape already; is

            8     that correct?

            9     A.  Correct.

           10     Q.  And you thought that was appropriately handled?

           11     A.  Absolutely.

           12     Q.  Okay.  And the next one on there is what?

           13     A.  Blood and fluid on sterile drapes.

           14     Q.  Okay.  Any evidence in the literature of that causing a

           15     PJI?

           16     A.  No.

           17     Q.  Okay.

           18     A.  And if it did, you would think it would cause a

           19     superficial infection, not a deep infection.

           20     Q.  Okay.  And next on there is the lights; is that right?

           21     A.  Correct.

           22     Q.  All right.  I would like to talk to you a little bit

           23     about the lights, and do you recall Dr. Presnal's testimony

           24     about how there is a sterile handle that is touched?

           25     A.  Right.  They usually have a little sterile plastic


                                  
                                        
                                                                             650



            1     sheet around them, yes.

            2     Q.  Okay.  Are those lights clean?

            3     A.  They're terminally cleaned every night.

            4     Q.  Okay.  And have you seen any single study in the

            5     medical literature based on the hundreds of articles you've

            6     reviewed where a prosthetic joint infection was linked back

            7     to bacteria that landed on an implant from a surgical

            8     light?

            9     A.  Never.

           10     Q.  I think you already talked about the staff shedding

           11     skin cells and your conclusions with respect to that based

           12     on the space suits?

           13     A.  Correct.

           14     Q.  As well as you'll see on the bottom left there is backs

           15     of surgeons?

           16     A.  Correct.

           17     Q.  Have you seen any study that suggested that the back of

           18     a surgeon could cause a prosthetic joint infection like the

           19     one Mr. Gareis suffered from?

           20     A.  No, nor would I think you would see a surgeon turn his

           21     back to the operative field.

           22     Q.  We've talked about the patient's skin, so we won't go

           23     back through that, but you have ruled that out, is that

           24     right, Doctor?

           25     A.  Correct.


                                  
                                        
                                                                             651



            1     Q.  There is also a notation of cabinets along the walls.

            2     Have you seen anything in the medical literature that

            3     suggests that a prosthetic joint infection can be caused by

            4     a cabinet on the wall?

            5     A.  No, I have no idea how you would even have a prosthetic

            6     joint touching the wall.

            7     Q.  How about trash receptacles?  Have you seen anything in

            8     the medical literature, a single study, that says a

            9     periprosthetic joint infection can be caused by a trash can

           10     in an operating room?

           11     A.  Never.

           12     Q.  Okay.  How about this drop bucket?  Have you seen

           13     anything in the medical literature that suggests a drop

           14     bucket in an OR could cause a periprosthetic joint

           15     infection?

           16     A.  No.  You would be depositing things in that bucket, and

           17     you would not be taking anything out of there.

           18     Q.  And the medical staff we have already talked about

           19     that.  Did you think that the protocol by the medical staff

           20     and the circulating nurses was appropriately followed?

           21     A.  Standard of care.

           22     Q.  Okay.  How about the suction drain?

           23     A.  Never seen a single report of a prosthetic joint

           24     infection caused by a suction machine.

           25     Q.  So based on ruling all those out, what was your


                                  
                                        
                                                                             652



            1     conclusion as to what caused Mr. Gareis's prosthetic joint

            2     infection during his surgery in November of 2010?

            3     A.  That more likely than not his prosthetic joint

            4     infection caused by Staph epidermidis was caused by the

            5     Bair Hugger.

            6     Q.  So I would like to talk to you on one last topic.  It

            7     will just take about --

            8               THE COURT:  Why don't you get rid of that now?

            9               MS. CONLIN:  Sure.

           10               And we'll be in recess until tomorrow morning at
