           25     Q.  Thank you.




                                                                             833



            1     A.  In mechanical and aerospace engineering.

            2     Q.  All right.  Dr. Elghobashi both and you I sometimes are

            3     going to need to work on speaking into the microphone so the

            4     court reporter can take down everything we're saying, okay?

            5     A.  Sure.

            6     Q.  I know you have a quiet voice sometimes.

            7               Dr. Elghobashi, what is your current employment?

            8     A.  University of California at Irvine.

            9     Q.  And I'm going to direct you there's a binder of

           10     materials in front of you.  Can you turn to Tab 704?

           11     A.  I have to put my glasses on.

           12     Q.  That's fine.

           13     A.  Which number, please?

           14     Q.  704.  Towards the front.

           15     A.  I have it.

           16     Q.  Do you see that?  And what do you see at Tab 704?  What

           17     is that document?

           18     A.  My CV.

           19     Q.  All right.  And is a CV a fancy way of saying your

           20     professional resume?

           21     A.  Yes.

           22     Q.  What is your educational background?

           23     A.  I have a master's degree in 1971 from U.S.C.  That's the

           24     University of Southern California.  I have a Ph.D. from

           25     University of London Imperial College in 1974.  And I have a




                                                                             834



            1     high doctorate called Doctor of Science, 1999, from

            2     University of London Imperial College.

            3     Q.  What is a Doctor of Science from the Imperial College?

            4     A.  It is given to a person after Ph.D.  When that person

            5     does research not related to the Ph.D.  It's like a new

            6     subject.

            7     Q.  A new subject, and you got that in 1999?

            8     A.  Correct.

            9     Q.  All right.  And are you a member of the National Academy

           10     of Engineering?

           11     A.  Correct.

           12     Q.  What is that?

           13     A.  It is the highest distinction for an engineering

           14     researcher in the U.S.

           15     Q.  And is that -- how do you become a member of the

           16     National Academy?

           17     A.  Some professors at prestigious University nominate that

           18     person without his knowledge.

           19     Q.  All right.  Is it something you can apply for?

           20     A.  No.

           21     Q.  All right.  So you were nominated by others for that?

           22     A.  By some people I do not know, yes.

           23     Q.  And how do you find out that you have been elected a

           24     member?

           25     A.  I received a Fed Ex letter saying you have been elected




                                                                             835



            1     a member of NA.

            2     Q.  Do you know how many people in the United States are

            3     members of the National Academy?

            4     A.  About 2,000.

            5     Q.  All right.  Do you know, Doctor, if defendants witness

            6     John Abraham is a member of the National Academy?

            7     A.  He is not.

            8     Q.  Doctor, have you from time to time been awarded -- have

            9     you received awards for your work?

           10     A.  Yes, but the recent one was in 2016.

           11     Q.  And what was that?

           12     A.  It's a senior award for international conference on

           13     multiphase flow.  That means it is given to a person working

           14     in that field every three years, so before me there were six

           15     people, some of them past away, and I was given that in

           16     Italy in 2016.

           17     Q.  And you were the seventh person to receive that award?

           18     A.  Correct.

           19     Q.  And you're a professor now?

           20     A.  A distinguished professor, yes.

           21     Q.  And where are you a professor?

           22     A.  University of California at Irvine.

           23     Q.  And does your CV, does your resume detail some of the

           24     research that you do?

           25     A.  Yes.




                                                                             836



            1     Q.  And I'd like to direct your attention to that 704, but

            2     turn to page 7.

            3     A.  Page 7 you said?

            4     Q.  Yes, Doctor.

            5     A.  Yes.

            6     Q.  And, for example, I turn your attention to the entry

            7     marked J2, it says, "Elghobashi SE," is that you?

            8     A.  Yes.

            9     Q.  And it says, "the effect of turbulent heat transfer on

           10     the propagation of an optical beam across supersonic

           11     boundary and free sheer layers?"

           12     A.  Yes.

           13     Q.  What does that mean?

           14     A.  This was done during Reagan administration for Star

           15     Wars.  Basically, we design, we were designing a system to

           16     shoot missiles before they arrived to the U.S. using flying

           17     an airplane, special airplane.  And the technology is you

           18     shoot a laser beam from our airplane that will destroy the

           19     rocket before it arrives to the U.S.

           20     Q.  All right.  And I would turn your attention to page 11

           21     of P704.

           22     A.  Yes.

           23     Q.  Are you with me, Doctor?

           24     A.  Yes.

           25     Q.  And at J38, what is that?




                                                                             837



            1     A.  Okay.  So this is an effective gravity on -- so NASA

            2     wanted to know would it be easier or difficult to extinguish

            3     a flame in a space station, so we had to do direct

            4     simulations of a turbine flow in the space station to see

            5     what will happen to the flame and how different it is from

            6     the flame on earth gravity because in the space station the

            7     gravity is almost zero.  We found out that it is difficult

            8     to extinguish the flame in the space station because that

            9     can be in your pocket, in your shoes, in the ceiling, on

           10     earth, you know all things will rise due to buoyancy.

           11     Q.  And that's the work you did for NASA?

           12     A.  Yes.

           13     Q.  And did you also do some work on nuclear waste in the

           14     Columbia River?

           15     A.  Yes.

           16     Q.  Is that J28?

           17     A.  28?

           18     Q.  Is that right?

           19     A.  Yes.

           20     Q.  All right.  And the entry on your CV says, "On

           21     predicting particle late and turbulent flows?"

           22     A.  Correct.

           23     Q.  What does that mean?

           24     A.  So in a turbine flow like in this room here, that's a

           25     turbine flow here.  And if you have some dust particles,




                                                                             838



            1     they will spread by turbulence, and this paper was

            2     explaining different regimes where particles can be

            3     disbursed.  And if so, many of them, they will affect

            4     turbulence and increase them further, they will be -- they

            5     collide.  So it's a complex problem, and this was written to

            6     answer some questions for the Westinghouse Corporation.

            7     They had a lot of nuclear waste dump in Hanford, Washington,

            8     near the Columbia river, and I was invited there to see how

            9     the nuclear waste will be disbursed.

           10     Q.  And during your work on this project, did you write

           11     about something that's referred to as the Elghobashi map?

           12     A.  Correct, it was included in that paper, yes.

           13     Q.  And do you know if that is widely cited?

           14     A.  I think more than a thousand times, yes, uh-huh.

           15     Q.  From time to time, do you do some work for the United

           16     States Navy?

           17     A.  Correct.

           18     Q.  Can you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what

           19     kind of work you do for the Navy?

           20     A.  The current aircraft carriers maximum speed is about 40

           21     knots.

           22     Q.  14 knots?

           23     A.  4-0, 40 knots, which is a little bit more than 40 miles

           24     per hour, and they would like to speed that to a hundred

           25     miles per hour.  And the main idea is to reduce drag on the




                                                                             839



            1     hull of the carrier.  And the Russians tried to do that in

            2     1960 and by making torpedos that go about 200 miles an hour

            3     in water, and the U.S. has the same technology.  But this

            4     one is about to increase the speed of the aircraft carrier

            5     by injecting air around the hull to reduce the water drag,

            6     and we did some work on that and published in these things,

            7     yeah, explaining how it happens, yes.

            8     Q.  And so you inject little bubbles around the outside of

            9     the ship?

           10     A.  The experimental in the lab would be little bubbles, but

           11     for a big ship like that you will have air jackets injected

           12     in slots around the hull, and it reduces drag by about

           13     40 percent.  That means since the drag is proportioned to

           14     the square of the velocity, you can see that for the same

           15     amount of energy given to the carrier, can go much faster.

           16     Or if you want to go slower, it will reduce the fuel

           17     consumption.

           18     Q.  So for those of us that aren't engineers, that means

           19     that you add air around the ship; is that right?

           20     A.  Correct, air jackets around the hull, yes.

           21     Q.  And that's going to make the aircraft carrier go faster?

           22     A.  Correct, because the drag, it remove the water causes

           23     more drag than air around the same object.

           24     Q.  All right.  And have you also done some work for the

           25     National Institute of Health recently?




                                                                             840



            1     A.  Oh, yes.

            2     Q.  And does some of that work appear at J56 on the bottom

            3     of page 12 of P704?

            4     A.  Yes.

            5     Q.  And what was this paper about?

            6     A.  For patients who have sleep apnea, it's an obstruction

            7     in the airway of a human being.  And we met with surgeons

            8     from around the country, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Stanford,

            9     and they told me, the surgeon told me that the success rate

           10     of sleep apnea operation is 50 percent, and they want to

           11     improve that.  So using our numerical simulations, they give

           12     us the geometry of the patient using optical tomography OCT

           13     in 3D, and we use that geometry in our code.  And we

           14     simulate the flow from the nostrils all the way to the

           15     trachea.  And the simulation 3D, time dependent simulation

           16     will show where the obstruction is before surgery and that

           17     will help the doctor to do the operation.  And after that,

           18     we can do it again with new tomography to show that the flow

           19     has improved, for example.

           20     Q.  So in each of these research papers that you've talked

           21     about this morning, do you use something called

           22     computational fluid dynamics?

           23     A.  Correct, yeah.  It's a general word, computational fluid

           24     dynamics covers the solution of the equations of motion of a

           25     fluid, but it's a big field, and it depends on the accuracy,




                                                                             841



            1     so we use the most accurate, which is called direct

            2     simulations.

            3     Q.  And we'll talk about that in a little bit more detail in

            4     just a minute.

            5     A.  Yes.

            6     Q.  In your CV at Plaintiff's Exhibit 704, do you have a

            7     number of peer reviewed publications as well?

            8     A.  I didn't understand the question.

            9     Q.  Sure.  The jury has heard some reference to peer

           10     reviewed?

           11     A.  Yes.

           12     Q.  What does that mean?

           13     A.  So when you do research and you have new results that

           14     has not, that have not been published before, you submit

           15     your paper to a journal and if the journal has high quality,

           16     not all journals have high quality.  For highest quality

           17     journal, they send it to three people, sometimes four.

           18     Confidentially they review the work, and they will send back

           19     the reviewed report to you, and the review can result in

           20     rejecting the paper from publication or asking you to revise

           21     it or accept it straightforward without any revision.

           22     Q.  And have you had papers peer reviewed before?

           23     A.  All my papers have been, all of them.

           24     Q.  Are you a peer reviewer for some journals?

           25     A.  Right.  Since the peer reviewing is free of charge, it's




                                                                             842



            1     a courtesy that you would be asked to review other author's

            2     paper similar to what they did to your paper, so that's a

            3     continuous process again free of charge.

            4     Q.  And do you see that as part of your obligation to move

            5     forward?

            6     A.  Definitely, yes.

            7     Q.  Doctor, do you get to pick, do you know who reviews your

            8     papers when there's a peer review?

            9     A.  No, it's completely confidential.  You only send it to

           10     the journal editor who would then send it to the reviewers

           11     confidentially.

           12     Q.  All right.  And in your experience, is it appropriate

           13     for an author of a peer reviewed paper to pick who reviews

           14     their paper?

           15     A.  Unheard of for me, yes.

           16     Q.  Is it generally an anonymous process?

           17     A.  Totally anonymous, totally, yes.

           18     Q.  All right.  And from time to time, do you provide

           19     speeches or lectures about your work?

           20     A.  Yes.

           21     Q.  You do?  Where do you give these kinds of speeches?

           22     A.  I beg your pardon?  I didn't hear you.

           23     Q.  Where do you give these kinds of talks?

           24     A.  All over the world.

           25     Q.  All around the world?




                                                                             843



            1     A.  Yes.

            2     Q.  Have you ever given talks here in Minnesota?

            3     A.  Yes, University of Minnesota.

            4     Q.  All right.  How long ago were you at the University of

            5     Minnesota?

            6     A.  Two years ago, I think, April, yeah.

            7     Q.  And you're a distinguished professor.  Do you have

            8     students that report to you?

            9     A.  Yes, only Ph.D. students.  I don't have other, only

           10     Ph.D. students, yes.

           11     Q.  How does a student come to study under you?

           12     A.  Well, many students who have a masters degree will apply

           13     to be a Ph.D. student with me, quite a bit every day I get

           14     so many, but I pick people.  So if I cannot find somebody in

           15     the U.S., I go to Japan or China or Europe to pick a certain

           16     student.  If I cannot travel, I ask a professor, a colleague

           17     of mine anywhere in these universities to interview the

           18     students, send me a report, sometimes it takes four hours or

           19     so, and I get that report, based on which I can say yes or

           20     no.

           21     Q.  Do you give these students a test before they come work

           22     for you?

           23     A.  Say that again?

           24     Q.  Do you test them before they come work for you?

           25     A.  Definitely, I, for some people in China I do Skype




                                                                             844



            1     interview.

            2     Q.  How many Ph.D. students come to study with you in a

            3     given year?

            4     A.  In the past or now or what?

            5     Q.  Both.

            6     A.  Well, in the past like dozens.  I also have

            7     post-doctorate, like me, people who already have a Ph.D.

            8     from Cal Tech or Stanford, and they want to come and spend

            9     two or three years with me as a post-doctor, so I have Ph.D.

           10     students and post-doctorals.

           11     Q.  And how many students are studying under you right now?

           12     A.  Right now I am winding down because I have many other

           13     obligations.  I have just two.  I don't accept many people

           14     because the work we do takes about two years for the student

           15     to learn what I'm doing, so I cannot have ten or so, yeah.

           16     Q.  And how long do they typically stay with you, your

           17     students?

           18     A.  Five years.  Two years to learn after Master's degree

           19     then three years to continue the work, yeah.

           20     Q.  All right.  Have you ever testified in a court before?

           21     A.  Never.  This is my first.  I've never been in a court

           22     before, yeah.

           23     Q.  Well, welcome.  Now, I'm going to direct your attention

           24     to the very first document in the binder in front of you

           25     which is PX1612.  Did you provide some demonstrative slides




                                                                             845



            1     to help you explain to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury?

            2     A.  Yes.

            3     Q.  What turbulence is and why it matters?

            4     A.  Yes, these slides I made maybe four years ago, yes.

            5     Q.  All right.

            6               MS. ZIMMERMAN:  Your Honor, we would offer PX1612,

            7     which is the first document in your binder as well for

            8     demonstrative purposes.

            9               THE COURT:  All right.

           10               MR. BLACKWELL:  No objection, Your Honor.

           11     BY MS. ZIMMERMAN:

           12     Q.  And the ladies and gentlemen of the jury have heard

           13     something about turbulence and particles.

           14     A.  Okay.

           15     Q.  And if could you explain to you ladies and gentlemen of

           16     the jury why turbulence and particles are relevant to the

           17     work you did in this matter?

           18     A.  Okay.  Shall I use graph or how do you want me to do

           19     that?

           20     Q.  Well, I'll start out with this is one of your first

           21     slides?

           22     A.  Oh, okay.  Do they see the same thing?

           23     Q.  They can see it all on their screens as well.

           24     A.  Okay.  This lecture was given to scientists at the

           25     University of California.  They're all National Academy of




                                                                             846



            1     Science.  These are the top scientists in physics,

            2     chemistry, biology, but not engineering.  So when I was

            3     elected to the National Academy of Engineering, I was asked

            4     by the University to give a lecture to these distinguished

            5     professors at our school who do not know about the subject;

            6     so, therefore, I had to present it in a way that a person

            7     who never studied turbulence could understand.  So I hope

            8     this will be also easy for you.

            9     Q.  All right.  And, Doctor, the ladies and gentlemen of the

           10     jury have heard some mention of the word laminar referring

           11     to airflow that comes down from the ceiling?

           12     A.  Yes.

           13     Q.  What does this slide show?

           14     A.  It shows a faucet in a kitchen and very small flow rate

           15     coming, and you can see liquid water, and it looks like a

           16     lens.  It's very clear.  There's a white and yellow wall

           17     behind that.  And you can see the water is so clear that you

           18     can see the white and yellow.  That's a laminar flow.  And

           19     laminar, the word "laminar" comes from Latin means composed

           20     of many laminae.

           21               By the way, in any hospital room, in any hospital

           22     room people misuse the word laminar.  There is no laminar

           23     flow in any operating room.  Never.  If you want to change

           24     the air in an operating room 25 times per hour, the flow is

           25     turbulent, period.  But this one to show you the laminar,




                                                                             847



            1     the turbulent, if you increase the flow rate in the faucet,

            2     you will see now the flow is vibrating, blurring, and you

            3     cannot see the distinction between the white and the yellow

            4     wall behind the water.  So that's a turbulent flow.  The

            5     same device, the only difference is increasing the flow

            6     rate.

            7     Q.  So have you ever used a garden hose?

            8     A.  Yes, a garden hose you can look at the flow coming out

            9     of the hose could be laminar or turbulent, depending on how

           10     much you turn the faucet on.

           11     Q.  All right.  Or if you maybe put your thumb over the edge

           12     of the hose?

           13     A.  If you put your thumb, it depends on the flow rate.

           14     Again, it can be stalled on the steady laminar, or if it is

           15     gushing at high speed, it would be a turbulent flow.

           16     Q.  All right.  And in any event, the airflow in an

           17     operating room is turbulent; is that right?

           18     A.  Always, always, but the many publication that says

           19     laminar flow, there is no laminar flow in the room, yeah.

           20     The flow in this room also is turbulent.

           21     Q.  All right.  And the flow in this room for those of us

           22     that aren't engineers, what is flowing?

           23     A.  Okay.  If you look at the faucet on the left or the

           24     right, the fluid coming, we call this fluid flow.  It means

           25     if you switch the valve off, there would be no flow.  Flow




                                                                             848



            1     means a massive fluid, it could be liquid, water or gas or

            2     air moving from one place to place with a certain velocity.

            3     That's a flow.

            4     Q.  Is air a fluid?

            5     A.  I beg your pardon?

            6     Q.  Is air a fluid?

            7     A.  Air is a fluid, water is a fluid, that's why when I

            8     mention water, I said liquid water because water can be

            9     vapor, liquid or solid ice.  There are three phases, yes.

           10     Q.  And you have a slide about rockets?

           11     A.  Right.  It shows here the space shuttle taking off and

           12     the hot gases from the engines coming out.  What you see in

           13     that picture I would say right away it's turbulent because

           14     there are many eddies.  Eddies is like a swirling part of

           15     the fluid rotating and turning with different sizes.  And

           16     once you see that, that's a turbulent flow.

           17     Q.  And are there eddies present in fluid sometimes that you

           18     can't see with your eyes?

           19     A.  Yes, there are many in the room.  If this ceiling is

           20     about 16-foot high, I would say the largest eddy here would

           21     be at about two to three feet, one meter, and it goes down

           22     to smaller than a millimeter.

           23               So it's like a Russian doll, you have big eddies

           24     containing smaller medium eddies, and so on, depending on

           25     the flow rate, yeah.  This was discovered by Da Vinci,




                                                                             849



            1     Leonardo Da Vinci in 1500, so it's not a new thing.

            2     Q.  I will move forward in your slides to that part.

            3     A.  Right, that's -- yes.

            4     Q.  So you said that Leonardo Da Vinci made some

            5     observations about turbulence?

            6     A.  Absolutely.  Yes, he is the one that created the word

            7     "turbulence."  Many Italians called turbolenza, which is

            8     written there.

            9     Q.  So is turbulence a newly discovered phenomenon?

           10     A.  No, it existed all -- the first person who really looked

           11     at it carefully was Da Vinci.

           12     Q.  All right.  And you had another couple of slides here?

           13     A.  Right.  Simple experiments in the river, he puts a plate

           14     across the flow, and he looked at what you see there are

           15     eddies of different sizes coming out of the plate, yes.

           16     Q.  All right.  And this is another drawing you --

           17     A.  Right, yeah, that picture appears in many books and

           18     turbulence because it's the first thing that showed eddies

           19     of different sizes, yes.

           20     Q.  And can you draw on the screen in front of you which

           21     parts there are eddies?

           22     A.  Okay.  So, oh, wow.  That's good.  And so let's see,

           23     these are big eddies, and medium eddies and then tiny like

           24     this, and much smaller, yes.

           25     Q.  Okay.  And in your work, you studied the movement of




                                                                             850



            1     particles in turbulent flow; is that right?

            2     A.  Right, that's correct.

            3     Q.  What does that mean to a non-engineer?

            4     A.  Okay.  So turbulent flow as you can see from that

            5     picture of Da Vinci, it's very complex, and people tried,

            6     Nobel Laureates tried many times to solve this mathematical

            7     but it's difficult.  And that is just a turbine fluid single

            8     phase.  If you put something in it, it becomes far more

            9     difficult to understand.  Something in it means you put

           10     particles in it or droplets like in a rain or bubbles like

           11     in the ocean.  It becomes highly complex because the

           12     equations become very complex.

           13     Q.  Is it the particles that make the equations complex?

           14     A.  Correct, yes.

           15     Q.  Who is Reynolds?

           16     A.  Reynolds was a British scientist.  First name Osborne

           17     Reynolds was a professor at University of Manchester, who

           18     the first person after Da Vinci to explain when a laminar

           19     flow becomes turbulent.

           20               Thank you for clearing that, yes, I didn't know

           21     how to do that.

           22     Q.  I should have done that for you.

           23     A.  Yes, thank you.  So he made a simple experiment.  If you

           24     go to Manchester University, you still see that device, and

           25     basically it's a simple.  It's a tank with a pipe connected




                                                                             851



            1     to it, a valve at the end of the pipe.  And he wanted to

            2     know what happens to that fluid, liquid water, so he put a

            3     little tank in the black marker there that has ink in it.

            4     Put blue ink and --

            5     Q.  Is that up here?

            6     A.  Oh, right.  Like in the bottom three pictures, you would

            7     see blue ink in the center and when he increases the flow of

            8     the -- open the valve a little bit more, that blue ink

            9     becomes irregular.  And when he increases the flow much

           10     more, it becomes turbulent.  It means just completely

           11     irregular, chaotic that you cannot repeat it again.

           12     Q.  Is turning that valve kind of like opening your kitchen

           13     sink?

           14     A.  Absolutely, yes, the same thing, but he put a marker so

           15     he would know what it is.

           16     Q.  And the marker was dye?

           17     A.  Ink, blue ink, yes.

           18     Q.  Right.  And you have some -- and he came up with an

           19     equation; is that right?

           20     A.  Right.  He wanted to tell people when the flow switches

           21     from laminar, the top one on the left to turbulent, the

           22     bottom one, it is now called Reynolds number.  Everybody in

           23     engineering fluid mechanics would know that but, of course,

           24     people after he died they called it that.  But he said it is

           25     a ratio between inertia, how fast the fluid moving to the




                                                                             852



            1     viscosity of the fluid.  For example, if you have honey in a

            2     jar, honey has higher viscosity than water; therefore, the

            3     denominator in that equation becomes so large, the Reynolds

            4     number becomes so low, that the fluid remains laminar.

            5               If you replace the honey by putting water or

            6     liquid water immediately for the same forces, the flow

            7     becomes turbulent and that's what you can see.  So he went

            8     from laminar to turbulent by increasing the numerator

            9     because the water is still the same in both, in all cases,

           10     but he increased the numerator which then how fast the thing

           11     is because the viscosity of water is still the same in all

           12     of it.  So you can change the number either by making the

           13     flow go faster or lowering the viscosity.

           14     Q.  Okay.  And why is what Reynolds did, why is his equation

           15     relevant to what you did in this case?

           16     A.  Okay.  So if you go to an operating room and you look at

           17     the flow coming from the grilles on the ceiling, if you know

           18     the flow rate that will tell you whether the flow in the

           19     room changes every 25 times per hour, you can see how many

           20     cubic meters coming here for second or how many cubic feet.

           21     If you know that mass flow rate, and you know the area of

           22     the grill, you can get the velocity, so you can calculate

           23     Reynolds numbers.

           24               So in the most, all operating room, there is

           25     number is between 6,000 and 10,000, so that means the flow




                                                                             853



            1     is turbulent, because you can see in the bottom of the

            2     screen, pipe flow becomes turbulent for Reynolds number

            3     greater than 2,000.  So all operating rooms Reynolds number

            4     is much higher than 2,000.  So all operating rooms have

            5     turbulent flow, yes.

            6     Q.  And you had another slide to kind of illustrate eddies

            7     in laminar flow versus turbulent flow?

            8     A.  Right.  This is magnification of Reynold's experiment,

            9     it will show that you if the flow is laminar, then ink in

           10     this case is red.  It's called dye trace.  So the first part

           11     of the picture, it's a schematic, show that the red dye goes

           12     in a straight line without any oscillation.

           13               If you increase the flow rate, that red dye will

           14     become pink because they diluted it.  It's mixed by eddies

           15     throughout the pipe.  That's what Reynolds.  This is an

           16     explanation of what happens in a Reynolds experiment.

           17     Q.  So turbulence increases mixing?

           18     A.  Absolutely, yes.

           19     Q.  In the air?

           20     A.  Right.  So if somebody is smoking and sitting in this

           21     room in the corner, and there is no air conditioning, it

           22     will take few minutes for the person in the other corner to

           23     smell the smoke.  However, if you have air conditioning and

           24     the fan is running, the person will smell smoke within a few

           25     seconds, yes.




                                                                             854



            1     Q.  And then you prepared a slide about what happens when

            2     you increase the Reynolds number, right?

            3     A.  Right.  So if you remember the Da Vinci's picture or

            4     schematic, you've seen large eddy marked in red and medium

            5     eddies and all this.  This schematic here shows that

            6     observed experimentally and mathematically increasing the

            7     Reynolds number, you create a wide spectrum of eddy sizes,

            8     so the top picture swirls number, a big eddy produced four

            9     eddies, this schematic is just a schematic.

           10               In the next one, increasing Reynolds number, you

           11     can see the middle size eddies broke down to smaller and

           12     smaller.  So, basically, if you want to discover what is the

           13     most important characteristic of a turbulent flow is that

           14     you have many eddies sizes like Da Vinci found.  And each

           15     size there's something in a flow like large eddies increase

           16     mixing, smaller eddy increase dissipation.  One of them is

           17     very important in chemical reaction when you have a chemical

           18     reaction in an engine, and the other one very important in a

           19     dust storm, for example, or a thunderstorm, yes.

           20     Q.  Is it fair to say that as the Reynolds number goes up,

           21     the number and size of eddies also goes up?

           22     A.  Absolutely, yes.

           23     Q.  What is the Navier-Stokes equations?

           24     A.  Okay.

           25     Q.  For simple people that are not engineers if you can?




                                                                             855



            1     A.  Okay.

            2     Q.  Like me.

            3     A.  All right.  Go back to the garden hose.  The garden

            4     hose, let us say you want to know what the velocity of water

            5     coming out near your flowers.  If you want to compute that,

            6     the first step is to give me the diameter of the pipe and

            7     the length of the pipe.

            8               Number two, we would like to know what did the

            9     pressure at the beginning of the garden hose, which is

           10     provided by the water company, like say three atmosphere.

           11     Then I need the pressure and the exit of the water hose that

           12     would be atmospheric, one atmosphere.  If you give me the

           13     pressure at the beginning, the pressure at the end, and turn

           14     it's liquid water, I know the properties, I know the

           15     geometry, then we can solve equations to give you the

           16     details of what happens in the garden hose.  These equations

           17     are called Navier-Stokes.

           18               Navier was a French engineer 1840; and Stokes, a

           19     great professor in England, and they derived these

           20     equations, which cannot be solved by hand because

           21     mathematically they are very difficult.

           22     Q.  And you prepared a slide showing the Navier-Stokes

           23     equation?

           24     A.  Yes, oh, wow, you're quick.  It is really only, okay,

           25     basically, that equation this is Navier, but basically it




                                                                             856



            1     says that is before this, there was Isaac Newton, who

            2     discovered Newton law, which is the force equal the mass of

            3     the motion moving object times acceleration.  F equals ma.

            4     People see that.  Navier and Stokes, both of them, used that

            5     concept to derive at an equation for any fluid motion of the

            6     left side, so we call inertia forces.  That's what Reynolds

            7     referred to.  This is the pressure ingredient, for the

            8     garden hose, what is the pressure at the beginning, what's

            9     the pressure at the end, divided by the length of the pipe.

           10     And this is the viscosity term of that fluid that you're

           11     moving.

           12               So it looks simple, but it cannot be solved by

           13     hand because the left side is difficult for mathematicians.

           14     Q.  I'm glad that looks simple to you, Doctor.

           15     A.  I beg your pardon?

           16     Q.  I'm glad that looks simple to you.

           17     A.  Right.  Stokes here, Cambridge, and yeah, those two are,

           18     their name is everywhere.  Every book on fluid dynamics you

           19     hear these names of very famous people, yes.

           20     Q.  All right.  And the Navier-Stokes equations have been

           21     known for sometime?

           22     A.  1845, yes.

           23     Q.  All right.  And you said that they cannot be solved by

           24     hand?

           25     A.  No, it cannot.  Many mathematician, Nobel Laureates




                                                                             857



            1     tried, they can't do that.

            2     Q.  And so how do you solve the Navier-Stokes equations in

            3     your work?

            4     A.  So you cannot do it mathematically, and so you get a

            5     pencil and paper.  If you have a pencil and paper and say A

            6     plus B equals six, A equals 3, then you tell me B is 3.

            7     That's analytical solution.  You cannot do that with this

            8     equation, so you have to do, use computer to do it.

            9     Q.  All right.  And what kind of computers do you use to do

           10     that?

           11     A.  It depends on what you want to do.  If you want to do my

           12     work, you need something called super computer, which has

           13     hundred thousand computer connected in parallel trying to

           14     simulate what happens in the brain to solve this equation.

           15     And when you do that, you get details of everything

           16     velocity, pressure, temperature, everything.

           17     Q.  And how long have you been working on super computers?

           18     A.  How long have I been doing?

           19     Q.  Yes.

           20     A.  1982, yeah.

           21     Q.  All right.  And super computers since the 1980's were

           22     capable of solving some of these equations?

           23     A.  Right, but only at very low Reynolds number.  So when

           24     you increase Reynolds number, you need a bigger computer

           25     because as we said earlier, the higher the Reynolds number,




                                                                             858



            1     the larger the range of eddies that you have.  So if you

            2     want to resolve all the eddies, smaller one, and the

            3     smallest one, and the medium and the big, you need the mesh

            4     to resolve these slow things, and the finer the mesh the

            5     more expensive it becomes to solve it, and more computers

            6     you need to do it.

            7     Q.  All right.  And that's something that you've been doing

            8     most of your professional life?

            9     A.  Yes.

           10     Q.  All right.

           11     A.  Somebody has to clear that.  I don't know.

           12     Q.  I can do that.

           13     A.  Then computers, yes, became available in 60's and super

           14     computers in 1980s.

           15     Q.  And that has held to solve the Navier-Stokes equations

           16     numerically, is that right?

           17     A.  Correct.

           18     Q.  Okay.  How does a super computer solve these kinds of

           19     equations?

           20     A.  So, so let's say you want to solve the flow in this room

           21     here similar to an operating room.  So I assume it's a cube.

           22     It's much easier, a cube.  And you divide it into little

           23     cubes.  The smallest cube will be as a small, at the

           24     smallest eddy you want to resolve.  And the largest cube

           25     will be about two meters or so, that would catch the large




                                                                             859



            1     eddy, so you have to make your mesh so fine to capture all

            2     the scales.

            3     Q.  So what is a mesh for the work you do?

            4     A.  Okay.  Let us assume you have some sand, and you want to

            5     pass only sand particle that's one millimeter.  So you get a

            6     sieve, and you make the finest mesh of the sieve a little

            7     bit greater than one millimeter, so only the one millimeter

            8     sand will fall through.  That's a flat thing.  In 3D, you

            9     have a 3D mesh so think of many sieves in 3D that capture

           10     the motion in 3D.  That's the first thing.

           11     Q.  Is the sieve that you're talking about, is it kind of

           12     like if I make noodles for my kids, and I put a strainer in

           13     the sink, it keeps the noodles from --

           14     A.  Correct, something like that, but now it will be -- it

           15     can have the regular like these lines on the wall here or

           16     irregular to match the object that, say a human being in a

           17     room, and you want to capture the flow near the head and the

           18     nose, you make your mesh not rectangles like this but are

           19     pyramids, tetrahedron, hexahedron, to match all the details.

           20     So when the flow comes on the face, you capture everything.

           21     Q.  And you referred to some shapes just then, tetrahedron?

           22     A.  Right.  I will just use this words, pyramid, you can

           23     make pyramids.

           24     Q.  Pyramids, yeah.

           25     A.  Or hexagon, put it in 3D, right.




                                                                             860



            1     Q.  And you use these shapes to help understand the fluid in

            2     a room?

            3     A.  If needed means if an obstacle that's irregular, you can

            4     do that, but if there is nothing in the room, you can make

            5     it all rectangular.  You always find the most accurate mesh

            6     for the flow situation that you have.

            7     Q.  All right.  And does the mesh get finer in certain

            8     places in your --

            9     A.  Correct, yes.  If you want to resolve something, you can

           10     have the mesh uniform everywhere, if you have no strange

           11     objects, but if some places in the room you have different

           12     shapes or human beings, you have to refine the mesh very

           13     close to that object, yes.

           14     Q.  So you have a finer mesh around obstructions?

           15     A.  Correct.

           16     Q.  What kinds of, what kinds of problems are solved with

           17     CFD?

           18     A.  It has been now more than from 1960 to now, that's like

           19     more than half a century, many, many, I cannot, yeah,

           20     everywhere.

           21     Q.  Airplanes?

           22     A.  Airplanes, ships, submarines, yes.

           23     Q.  You mentioned missile defense, the Star Wars program?

           24     A.  Yes, correct.

           25     Q.  Is CFD used for satellites?




                                                                             861



            1     A.  Yes, definitely.

            2     Q.  Weather patterns?

            3     A.  Definitely.  Actually, the first CFDs were created to

            4     predict the weather.  That's the first.  The first super

            5     computer was designed to predict the weather.  And you can

            6     see the flow around the earth is turbulent.  That's why the

            7     weather predictions every night on tv are not correct.  They

            8     give you, they're very close within an hour after that.

            9     Q.  That happens in California too?

           10     A.  Everywhere, yes.  Yeah.

           11     Q.  So you did work, computational fluid dynamics or CFD

           12     work for this case, correct?

           13     A.  Correct.

           14     Q.  And did you have a team that helped you?

           15     A.  Correct.

           16     Q.  Who was on your team?

           17     A.  Professor in the Oregon State University and four Ph.D.

           18     students.

           19     Q.  All right, and what was your role in this?

           20     A.  My role was to think of every step in the project from

           21     the beginning, what equation to solve, what mesh to use,

           22     boundary conditions, yes.

           23     Q.  What's a boundary condition, Doctor?

           24     A.  Okay, let's go back to the garden hose.  In order to use

           25     Navier-Stokes equation to predict the flow inside a garden




                                                                             862



            1     hose, the first thing you do is to define the geometry.

            2     Q.  The geometry?

            3     A.  The geometry of the pipe, the ground, or the square or

            4     how long.  In order to solve Navier-Stokes equation, you

            5     have to tell the equation there is a wall there, a wall

            6     meaning the wall of the pipe.  Otherwise, if you don't put

            7     boundary to the flow, it will assume the pipe is open to the

            8     atmosphere.

            9               So in the computer program you say at such

           10     distance from to the center line of the pipe, there's a

           11     wall, and that's one boundary condition.  Another boundary

           12     condition at the inlet of the pipe you have to tell them

           13     what the pressure, the velocity, and the exit you have to

           14     say what the pressure is.  All these are boundary

           15     conditions.  If you have the wrong boundary condition, the

           16     equations are fine, but you'll get a different solution.  So

           17     prescribing correct boundary conditions is crucial to

           18     predicting a given flow.

           19     Q.  And did you do that with your work in this case?

           20     A.  Correct, yes.

           21     Q.  Did you also set the initial conditions?

           22     A.  Correct.  So in the garden hose, I assumed the pipe was

           23     running for a few seconds, but if you say I want solved from

           24     the instant I opened the valve that becomes unsteady

           25     solution, you have to tell me that the pipe was empty, the




                                                                             863



            1     garden hose was empty or full.  I have to know for weather

            2     predictions difficulty in weather predictions.  If we don't

            3     have enough mesh around the earth to tell you what the

            4     temperature, the rain, the pressure, at each point around

            5     the sphere; therefore, you need millions and billions of

            6     station to tell you initial conditions, so it's basically

            7     it's a guess work.  So if you have wrong initial conditions,

            8     you also get the wrong weather predictions.

            9     Q.  That explains that.  So you -- was your work in this

           10     matter published?

           11     A.  I couldn't hear the first part.

           12     Q.  I'm sorry.  Was the work that you did in this case

           13     published?

           14     A.  You mean in the case we're?

           15     Q.  Yes.

           16     A.  Yes, it was published, yes.

           17     Q.  And I will direct your attention to P1419 in the binder

           18     in front of you.

           19     A.  Yes.

           20     Q.  Do you recognize that?

           21     A.  Yes.  That's a paper.

           22     Q.  That's the paper you had published?

           23     A.  Correct.

           24     Q.  Is this a peer reviewed publication?

           25     A.  Yes, yes.




                                                                             864



            1     Q.  And why does your name appear last?

            2     A.  In academic institutions, the senior officer is always

            3     at the end.  You want to encourage younger students to put

            4     their names first.  Unless, I'm the only author then my name

            5     would appear alone but in all my papers, the student or

            6     post-doc name would appear first.

            7     Q.  And you have how many co-authors on this paper?

            8     A.  Four people.

            9     Q.  Dr. He?

           10     A.  He is Mr. He, yes.  Mr. Karra, and Mr. Pakseresht, and

           11     Professor Apte, and myself.

           12               MS. ZIMMERMAN:  The plaintiffs would offer

           13     Plaintiff's Exhibit 1419 under 803(18).  I'm not going to

           14     publish it.

           15               MR. BLACKWELL:  No, objection, Your Honor, if it's

           16     not published.

           17               THE COURT:  It's received, pursuant to that rule.

           18     BY MS. ZIMMERMAN:

           19     Q.  And Dr. Elghobashi, was this paper a peer reviewed

           20     publication?

           21     A.  Correct.

           22     Q.  And what journal was it published in?

           23     A.  It's written somewhere here.  International Journal

           24     of -- I think, I cannot see it, but I remember it's

           25     International Journal of Numerical Methods and Biomedical




                                                                             865



            1     Flow, I think.

            2     Q.  The International Journal of Numerical Methods in

            3     Biomedical Engineering?

            4     A.  Or Biomedical Flow.

            5     Q.  Was it published this year?

            6     A.  Yes.  At the beginning of the year.  I remember February

            7     or January or.

            8     Q.  And before we get into what you did on this case, I

            9     assume you're getting paid for the work that you've done in

           10     this case?

           11     A.  Correct.

           12     Q.  Do you know if your co-authors have been paid for the

           13     work they did as well?

           14     A.  Yeah.  They, definitely, they will be the first paid,

           15     yes.

           16     Q.  All right.  Do you have any idea what you've been paid

           17     for the work you've done?

           18     A.  Do I have an idea?

           19     Q.  Yes.

           20     A.  I think the total cost may be about 200,000.

           21     Q.  In peer reviewed publications, do journals require

           22     conflict of interest statements?

           23     A.  I'm not aware of any of my papers.  I was asked the top

           24     journals, like Journal of Fluid Mechanics in Cambridge,

           25     Physics Fluids in America, never asked me to do anything




                                                                             866



            1     like that.  Only time you acknowledge the financial support

            2     is from government agencies like NASA, DOE, NSF, Air Force,

            3     Navy.  They ask you when they give you a grant for the

            4     student, they tell you when you publish a paper, you have to

            5     acknowledge we do that.  But, otherwise, I mean I don't call

            6     that a conflict of interest.  I said acknowledgement of

            7     support.  That's it.

            8     Q.  You acknowledge the support?

            9     A.  Right, right.  The word "conflict of interest" I have

           10     seen only when I review proposals for the government like

           11     the Army, the Air Force, the Navy, they ask me before I

           12     review it, if I have conflict of interest, if I know the

           13     principal investigator.  That's the only time I heard the

           14     word "conflict of interest" in academia.  I never heard it

           15     before.

           16     Q.  And have you submitted a conflict of interest statement

           17     for your paper here?

           18     A.  Only after I think the other side requested it.  I was

           19     shocked, but the editor said you did not say this or that,

           20     and they showed me the statement.  I think it's coming from

           21     3M, so we replied by putting the lines who got paid or

           22     something like that.  Yeah.

           23     Q.  All right.  And you were hired -- who hired you to do

           24     this work?

           25     A.  The name of the counsel?




                                                                             867



            1     Q.  The plaintiff's lawyers?

            2     A.  You mean Anne Andrews?

            3     Q.  Yeah.  Well, and me, right?

            4     A.  Right, right, right.

            5     Q.  And did you believe you had a conflict of interest to

            6     declare for this paper?

            7     A.  No, no, I was just doing it for scientific interest to

            8     see if this is true or not true the fact.  I had no idea.  I

            9     just, yeah.

           10     Q.  All right.  And was it your intention, well, what was

           11     your intention about publishing the results of your

           12     research?

           13     A.  Well, I told the group of counsel I met in July 2016, I

           14     told them that problem is simple, simpler than the things I

           15     do in general, but of interest to see if this is true or

           16     not.  And if we find that the Bair Hugger heating does not

           17     show squames moving, we were right, I told them we write

           18     whatever we find, and they agreed.  So I did not promise

           19     anything.

           20     Q.  So you were going to publish the work no matter what?

           21     A.  Right, my reputation is more important than taking a

           22     hundred dollar to write.  This is not to buy a car or sugar

           23     or something.

           24     Q.  Okay.

           25     A.  Yeah.




                                                                             868



            1     Q.  So let's talk about what you did in this case?

            2     A.  Yes.

            3     Q.  What's the problem that you approached?

            4     A.  How did I do it?

            5     Q.  Well, did you have a hypothesis?

            6     A.  Well, I said if operating room temperature is about

            7     16 degrees centigrade, and a device puts hot air near the

            8     table, just basic science will tell you there's a plume

            9     coming like if you have a chimney, and that can cause things

           10     light or particle to float around.  That's just simple

           11     logic.  It doesn't require a Ph.D. or anything.

           12     Q.  Okay, and that was the hypothesis, that was what you

           13     assumed when you started?

           14     A.  Right, but I didn't say definitely the squames will

           15     reach the operating.  I said we will find out because this

           16     is again Navier-Stokes equation.  You cannot guess the

           17     results.  You look at the equation is complex.  You have to

           18     do it numerically.  You cannot do it by hand.  You cannot

           19     guess.  You have to do the computation.  It's mandatory if

           20     you want an answer.

           21     Q.  Okay.  And as you were preparing to do your work in this

           22     case, what did you look at?  Did you look at articles?

           23     A.  When the counselor showed me I mean told me about the

           24     problem, I had no idea about this.  I never did anything

           25     about operating room flow.  I had to read paper, so I read




                                                                             869



            1     few papers about the subject using Google, and that's the

            2     beginning, yes.

            3     Q.  All right.  And you have never looked at any medical

            4     records in this case, have you?

            5     A.  Never.  I have no idea.  Yeah, I don't know.

            6     Q.  And you're not going to be telling the jury about you're

            7     not a medical doctor, correct?

            8     A.  No, never, I was not, yes.

            9     Q.  All right.  Have you ever looked at any of the reports

           10     from other doctors in this case, Dr. Stonnington, for

           11     example?

           12     A.  No, I don't know.  No, yeah, nothing.

           13     Q.  So what did you do after you had a hypothesis, what did

           14     you do to start to solve the problem of the effect of the

           15     Bair Hugger in an operating room?

           16     A.  Again, first thing as a garden hose, geometry, so we get

           17     the room geometry.

           18     Q.  And where did you get that?

           19     A.  I got it from 3M.  They have a video on the web that

           20     shows the dimensions of the room, seven meter by seven meter

           21     by six or something like that.

           22     Q.  So did you use those same dimensions in your --

           23     A.  Same thing.  We wanted to do everything as shown, and we

           24     got a 3D CAD for the contents of an operating room in

           25     Rochester, I think, from counsel.




                                                                             870



            1     Q.  Rochester, New York?

            2     A.  Yes.

            3     Q.  Okay.

            4     A.  And so the first thing has to do with the geometry

            5     followed by the mesh, which is very complex.  The mesh is

            6     crucial because there's an operating table, there is a

            7     patient, there are medical staff, side tables, surgery --

            8     surgical lamps.  Everything we had to account for this in

            9     detail, so the mesh is quite complex, and I think in the

           10     paper and the report it shows how it is done.

           11               And as we tell the students who do CFD, the first

           12     step is to do something called mesh accuracy and grid

           13     independence test.

           14     Q.  Grid independence?

           15     A.  Grid independence test means the results should not

           16     depend on the mesh that you finally use means, you start

           17     with a course mesh means cheaper computing.  You keep

           18     refining it until the results are not changing by about one

           19     percent.  Then you say, okay, that will be the mesh.

           20               So mesh accuracy is number one.  If you don't have

           21     -- you can get anything if you have a course mesh, you just

           22     rubbish, yeah.

           23     Q.  Were you responsible for the mesh in this case?

           24     A.  Right.

           25     Q.  All right.  Did you determine a Reynolds number?




                                                                             871



            1     A.  The Reynolds number is determined by how many times you

            2     change the air in an operating room.  For our case, we used

            3     25 because it was described in many papers that 25 is the

            4     normal.

            5     Q.  Normal air change rate?

            6     A.  Right.  We can do any, you just tell us what air so we

            7     took the one that is available, but it is not a major thing.

            8     Q.  And do you know if that's the same air change rate that

            9     3M's witness used?

           10     A.  That was -- no, I mean, from their video on the web it

           11     showed that, so we took the number from that, yeah, 25.

           12     Q.  And did you include the inlet grilles and exit grilles

           13     in your mesh?

           14     A.  We have ten inlet grilles above the operating room and

           15     four exit grilles in each of the four walls nearest to the

           16     floor, yes.

           17     Q.  And did you have multiple sources of heat in your --

           18     A.  Correct.  So that will be each human being, if a human

           19     being sits in a room on a chair like this, each person, any

           20     of us emits about a hundred watt.  That means like about,

           21     and if you do have some size, you emit more, so per person

           22     it's about a hundred watt.

           23               Then the surgical lamps temperature was about 93

           24     centigrade.  The patient, of course, the, yeah, the so

           25     surgical lamps.  Then the Bair Hugger, which is about for




                                                                             872



            1     the model 750, the amount of power is one kilowatt, so, yes.

            2     Q.  And did you do this work by the way for two different

            3     models of a Bair Hugger?

            4     A.  So in the first part of the project we did the 750

            5     model, and the second one we did the 505.

            6     Q.  All right.  And is this the 505?

            7     A.  Right.

            8     Q.  Sitting here on the table?

            9     A.  Yes.

           10     Q.  And you've seen this before?

           11     A.  I've seen pictures not the exact machine, but I've seen

           12     Google pictures, yes.

           13               MS. ZIMMERMAN:  Plaintiffs would offer Plaintiff's

           14     Exhibit 1470 into evidence.

           15               THE COURT:  For demonstrative purposes, you can go

           16     ahead and ask this witness as long as he's there.

           17               MR. BLACKWELL:  For demonstrative purposes, no

           18     objection, Your Honor.

           19     BY MS. ZIMMERMAN:

           20     Q.  And so you also did a CFD model of the effect of this

           21     machine, correct?

           22     A.  Correct.

           23     Q.  Were there obstacles in your mesh?

           24     A.  Oh, you mean --

           25     Q.  The table?




                                                                             873



            1     A.  Yeah, table, the operating table.  The drape over the

            2     blanket, the Bair Hugger itself the 750; two side tables,

            3     yeah.

            4     Q.  And then did you determine which equations you wanted to

            5     use to solve this problem?

            6     A.  Again, no choice.  Navier-Stokes, you get the same

            7     thing.  It's always Navier-Stokes and because we have

            8     heating, we have to solve an additional equation called the

            9     energy equation.

           10     Q.  And what is that?

           11     A.  It will tell you if you heat part of the flow, how that

           12     heat will spread throughout the room, yes.

           13     Q.  So I think the jury has heard and will hear some

           14     testimony about CFD and several different kinds of

           15     calculations that you do?

           16     A.  Yes.

           17     Q.  Are there three types of CFD?

           18     A.  Okay.  They're all CFD, but three different ways if you

           19     are talking about turbulence.  So again turbulent the big

           20     elephant in the room.  CFD, you can do many things that has

           21     no fluid or anything, but if you want turbulent flow then

           22     you do, you have choices.

           23     Q.  And what are those choices?

           24     A.  The cheapest one is called RANS, Reynold, again the

           25     Mr. Reynolds; average Navier-Stokes.  R for Reynolds, A for




                                                                             874



            1     average, N for Navier, S for Stokes, and that doesn't give

            2     you eddy sizes or anything.  It's just the simplest way to

            3     do it.  Most industries view that for noncritical flows.

            4     Q.  Is there -- what are the other two ways to do it?

            5     A.  So that would be the cheapest most crude way of doing

            6     it.  The highest end will be a direct numeric simulation.

            7     That's like the gold standard.  It has no approximation.  It

            8     gives you details in space and time of every eddy,

            9     everything you want to know.  And that's my part, my

           10     research is for past 35 years in that.  That's very

           11     expensive and cannot do high RANS number flow because we do

           12     not have bigger super computer here or in China.  China has

           13     the biggest but still cannot do that.  So you cannot use DNS

           14     for a flow of an airplane or a car.  So it becomes just like

           15     a microscope, it gives you details that you can use the

           16     results of DNS to help RANS.  And in the middle between

           17     them, something called large-eddy simulation, and that's

           18     what we did for this project.  It is the only way to do the

           19     turbulent flow in an operating room accurately and available

           20     super computer can do it and that does not resolve the very

           21     tiny scales because they cost so much money.  Large eddies,

           22     LES, large-eddy simulation, it can resolve the big eddies

           23     but not the tiniest one because of the cost.

           24     Q.  So you first told the jury about RANS, right?

           25     A.  Yes, RANS.  Right, yes, RANS.




                                                                             875



            1     Q.  And more precise than that would be?

            2     A.  LES.  And the highest one is called DNS, direct

            3     numerical simulation.

            4     Q.  And LES is what you did here?

            5     A.  For this project because it's the only way possible.

            6     You can do RANS, and I think some people in papers like in

            7     NIH, they use HANS, which is, again, I consider it rubbish.

            8     Q.  RANS?

            9     A.  Yes, for this kind of flow, yes.

           10     Q.  And why is that?

           11     A.  You remember we talked about boundary condition, RANS

           12     will fail miserably near the walls of the room, near the

           13     faces of the surgeons, near the table.  When you get closer

           14     to the wall of anything, RANS fails.

           15     Q.  It doesn't have the same kind of precision?

           16     A.  Well, it just gives you results.  Wall region close to

           17     an object is very crucial for turbulent flow because that's

           18     a high sheer stress.

           19     Q.  Sheer like in an airplane.  In your work from your

           20     published paper, do you know how much heat is generated by

           21     the Bair Hugger?

           22     A.  I just read the manuscript.  It shows the 3M report or

           23     manual is one kilowatt amount of power so the temperature

           24     would be 38, 41, 43.

           25     Q.  Okay.  I'm going to direct your attention to 1337, which




                                                                             876



            1     is in the book right in front of you.

            2     A.  Yes.

            3     Q.  And if you turn to page 12 of that document.  First of

            4     all, what is that document, do you know?

            5     A.  Page 12?

            6     Q.  Yes.

            7     A.  Yes, it's specifications.

            8     Q.  Do you know what this document is on the first page?

            9     A.  3M Bair Hugger Model 505.

           10     Q.  And what is it?

           11     A.  You mean --

           12     Q.  What is the title of the document, do you know?

           13     A.  Temperature management unit.

           14     Q.  Model 505.  Is this the operator's manual?

           15     A.  Yes.

           16     Q.  What do you see on page 12?  That was relevant to the

           17     work you did here.

           18     A.  The last four lines, high 43 plus or minus 3C, medium 38

           19     plus or minus 3C, low 32 plus or minus 3C, C means

           20     centigrade.

           21     Q.  And is that the operating temperatures for the Bair

           22     Hugger?

           23     A.  Right.

           24     Q.  And did you use this information in doing the work that

           25     you did in this case?




                                                                             877



            1     A.  Right.

            2               MS. ZIMMERMAN:  Plaintiffs are going to offer

            3     1337.

            4               MR. BLACKWELL:  Your Honor, no objection to only

            5     this provision.

           11               THE COURT:  All right.  The modification will be

           12     made at the appropriate time.

           13               MS. ZIMMERMAN:  Okay.  Permission to publish to

           14     the jury.

           15               THE COURT:  Go ahead.

           16     BY MS. ZIMMERMAN:

           17     Q.  There we go.  Thank you.  And is this the document that

           18     you're looking at in front of you?

           19     A.  Correct.

           20     Q.  And does it outline the temperatures from the machine?

           21     A.  Yes.

           22     Q.  And which temperature did you use?

           23     A.  I think 41.  I don't recall the exact figure but 41.

           24     Q.  And on the screen in front of you, does it show the

           25     average temperatures at the end of the hose?




                                                                             878



            1     A.  Yes.

            2     Q.  And that's 43 degrees Celsius; is that right?

            3     A.  Correct.

            4     Q.  And it also says the air temperatures reaching the

            5     patient are approximately two degrees centigrade lower than

            6     the listed temperatures; is that right?

            7     A.  Correct.  We use 31 or 41.

            8     Q.  41 degrees?

            9     A.  Yes.

           10     Q.  Do you know if that's the same temperature that 3M used

           11     in doing their work on this matter?

           12     A.  I didn't look at their work.  I didn't, yeah.

           13     Q.  Now, you modelled some draping in your work?

           14     A.  Correct.

           15     Q.  And what import, if any, was the draping in the model

           16     that you did?

           17     A.  Okay.  Before we did the work, we went with counsel to a

           18     surgery room in Santa Monica, California, orthopedic surgery

           19     hospital, and we asked the nurse to set up the Bair Hugger

           20     blanket, drape, as she usually does in an operating room.

           21     And we took one of our colleague of the lawyer, she's a

           22     lawyer, and we asked her to lie down on the operating table

           23     covered with the Bair Hugger blanket, tied the things, and

           24     covered the drape, and we asked the nurse to turn the Bair

           25     Hugger on.  And we asked the lawyer on the bed whether




                                                                             879



            1     there's air coming toward her face, and she said, no,

            2     because she has contact lenses and if the hot air is coming

            3     to her eye, she would stop the thing.  So she said no air

            4     coming up.  So we went around, there were other lawyers.  We

            5     looked at the airflow and all the air was coming at the

            6     edges of the drape.

            7     Q.  All right.  Have you seen one of these before?

            8     A.  Correct.

            9     Q.  And what is this?

           10     A.  It's a blanket that should be connected to the Bair

           11     Hugger with a hose.

           12     Q.  All right.  And when you went to the operation, the

           13     operating room?

           14     A.  Correct.

           15     Q.  In Santa Monica?

           16     A.  Yes.

           17     Q.  Was there anything over this?

           18     A.  Yes, it's the same thing, yes.

           19     Q.  Was there anything placed on top of the blanket?

           20     A.  The drape, it's a plastic drape.  The nurse put it on.

           21     That's how they keep, yeah.

           22     Q.  All right.  And were those part of the assumptions that

           23     you made as you were --

           24     A.  Right.  So from what we saw, we know the flow rate

           25     coming from the blower, and we divided equally to the edge




                                                                             880



            1     of the drapes so uniformly coming to keep the mass flow rate

            2     the same, yes.

            3     Q.  Okay.  So have you been asked to evaluate the effect

            4     that the Bair Hugger has on movement of particles in an

            5     operating room?

            6     A.  That was the main object of all the work, yes.

            7     Q.  And are you prepared to explain to the ladies and

            8     gentlemen of the jury what your work was with respect to the

            9     Bair Hugger and the CFD you did?

           10     A.  Okay.  So after --

           11     Q.  Could I stop you for just one second?

           12     A.  Yes.

           13     Q.  Thank you.  Do you have an opinion that you hold to a

           14     reasonable degree of engineering certainty about the effect

           15     of the Bair Hugger machine on the disbursement of squame

           16     size particles in an operating room?

           17     A.  My opinion is based on our results.

           18     Q.  All right.

           19     A.  I had no opinion before because of Navier-Stokes you

           20     cannot guess about it.  After we did the computations, I can

           21     say now, that, yes, the Bair Hugger causes squames to arise

           22     from the floor to higher elevation.

           23     Q.  All right.  And does that include over the operating

           24     room table?

           25     A.  Correct.




                                                                             881



            1     Q.  And also to the surgical site?

            2     A.  Say that again?

            3     Q.  Does your model also show squames reaching the surgical

            4     site?

            5     A.  Yes.

            6     Q.  So what did your LES model include in the operating

            7     room?  Are there squames?

            8     A.  Right.  So after we did the geometry as shown by 3M, we

            9     said the boundary condition from the drape, and in order to

           10     give 3M the best case scenario I mean in their favor, we put

           11     the squames only on the floor, not anywhere in the room,

           12     about one centimeter from the floor, so we put a layer

           13     around the operating table with three million squames.

           14               To give you an idea, each human being sheds 20

           15     million squames per hour.  Think of that, that's a lot of

           16     squames.  And if you have five people, they shed hundred

           17     million squames per hour.  To follow these squames, all of

           18     them with the correct way we do it would be very expensive.

           19     So we put only three million on the floor, only three

           20     million.  And if you look from the top you look on the

           21     table, the operating table, the squames are taking a

           22     U-shape, means one side of the bed, one side of the bed, and

           23     one side near the Bair Hugger.  And we -- these are

           24     stagnant, they're not moving, and we turn the blower on.  We

           25     follow them.  Each one we follow, each individual squame,




                                                                             882



            1     there's an equation to describe the motion of each squame,

            2     and we followed that.  It will give you a trajectory where

            3     each -- so I give them a color code.  I give green, red, and

            4     green, red then yellow just to see the turbulent mixing how

            5     it will affect, so you can see I think there's a video that

            6     shows some of them go from the green side to the yellow side

            7     or red side and so on, to monitor them.

            8     Q.  Doctor, so the colors of the squame in your model, is

            9     that just so that we can visualize?

           10     A.  Absolutely.  It's only for visualization.  The color has

           11     no effect on anything.  Only the size of the squame, and

           12     it's mass and density.

           13     Q.  And so the super computer, what does it do with the

           14     particle?  I think you explained to the jury it calculates

           15     where it moves?

           16     A.  Right.  So in addition to what we do with Navier-Stokes

           17     equation to tell you the velocity and the pressure and the

           18     temperature each point in the operating room,

           19     simultaneously, you saw the motion of each of the three

           20     million squame to see where they go.

           21     Q.  So the computers are doing the Navier-Stokes equation

           22     for each one of the three million squames?

           23     A.  No, Navier-Stokes only for fluid motion.  If you have

           24     the -- squames have the density like liquid water, so think

           25     of them as very tiny rain drops.  Navier-Stokes only




                                                                             883



            1     applies to a continuum fluid means the molecules 22 to the

            2     10 in one centimeter cube.  That's just one fluid.

            3     Particles are foreign objects like oranges.  They have their

            4     own equation, which took 150 years to develop, so we solved

            5     that equation individually to each squame.

            6     Q.  So you solved that equation for each one of the three

            7     million squames?

            8     A.  We saw that every microsecond three million.  That's why

            9     you need a super computer.  You can't do it on a laptop or

           10     some other machine.

           11     Q.  How long did it take the super computer to this?

           12     A.  If the machine is running without interruption, it takes

           13     about 10, 12 hours.  It will take 200 years if you want to

           14     do it in other machine.

           15     Q.  Okay.

           16     A.  Yeah.

           17     Q.  Which super computer did you use?

           18     A.  The one in University of Texas at Austin.

           19     Q.  All right.  Can anybody use the --

           20     A.  No, no, in order to have access to these machines, you

           21     have to write a proposal to a National Science Foundation to

           22     tell them I would like to solve this problem.  It will be a

           23     peer reviewed by five people around the country, again,

           24     confidentially, and when they see that your work deserves to

           25     use a super computer, they will let you do that.  Okay.




                                                                             884



            1     Q.  And your work here in this case was done on the super

            2     computer, right?

            3     A.  Correct, yes.

            4     Q.  Did you do a model with the Bair Hugger on and the Bair

            5     Hugger off?

            6     A.  That is essential.  In order in science to see the

            7     effect of something, you have to show without and with, then

            8     you see the difference.

            9     Q.  And what, if anything, did you learn from doing the CFD

           10     LES with the Bair Hugger off?

           11     A.  With the Bair Hugger off, the airflow from the ceiling

           12     scavenges everything in front of it, and the flow exits from

           13     the floor, exit grilles near the floor.

           14     Q.  So did you see that the airflow was effective?

           15     A.  Yeah, we can follow, yeah, we can follow, yeah, uh-huh.

           16     Q.  Okay.  Do you recall what mass flow rate you used in

           17     solving these equations?

           18     A.  Mass flow rate from the ceiling or from the Bair Hugger?

           19     There are two.

           20     Q.  From the Bair Hugger?

           21     A.  I don't recall.  It is given somewhere in a table.  We

           22     use that from Bair Hugger, yes.

           23     Q.  Do you know if it was from a 3M document?

           24     A.  Yes.  I recall I think we used a little bit lower than

           25     what was written by few percent.




                                                                             885



            1     Q.  Do you know if you used the same mass flow rate as 3M's

            2     witness?

            3     A.  Again, if you're referring to the video of 3M, they had

            4     a table that would probably use the same, yes.

            5     Q.  And did the LES CFD that you did on the Model 505

            6     generate videos?

            7     A.  Correct.

            8     Q.  And is that something that this super computers

            9     typically do when you do this kind of work?

           10     A.  Not typically, but you ask them to do it like after you,

           11     after you do the simulation, you save certain parts in a

           12     given time period, you store them, and then you run a video

           13     generating code using your data.  So the video is --

           14     remember, when you have hundreds of millions of points in

           15     the mesh, the mesh will have tens of million, hundreds of

           16     million, you cannot read the results at each point.  It's

           17     impossible to read in time every microsecond of flow

           18     changing, so the best way to visualize that is to create a

           19     video to tell you how everything is moving, yes.

           20     Q.  And is that something that you do with some regularity

           21     in your work?

           22     A.  Right, right.  That's the way to do for DNS or LES

           23     because the amount of data is huge, yes.

           24     Q.  All right.  And do you know was the super computers that

           25     you worked on or that you used for this, were they




                                                                             886



            1     functioning properly?

            2     A.  Of course.  I mean otherwise, they will tell us if

            3     they're not.  You get an e-mail every time something the

            4     machine has stopped for maintenance, they always tell you,

            5     yes.

            6     Q.  Were the equations that you used for your LES accurate?

            7     A.  Yes, yes, definitely, yes.

            8     Q.  And were the equations completed by the super computer?

            9     A.  I didn't hear the last verb.

           10     Q.  Was your work complete?  You finished the equations or

           11     the super computer finished the equation?

           12     A.  Right, of course, right, yes.

           13     Q.  And would you consider the data that was generated by

           14     the super computers to be reliable?

           15     A.  Absolutely, yes.

           16     Q.  Does that include the videos that the super computer

           17     generated?

           18     A.  Absolutely, yes.

           19     Q.  And would that help you to explain to the ladies and

           20     gentlemen of the jury the effect of the Bair Hugger Model

           21     505 on an operating room?

           22     A.  Yes.

           23               THE COURT:  We're going to take a 15-minute

           24     recess.

           25                             (11:08a.m.)




                                                                             887



            1                              (11:27 a.m.)

            2               THE COURT:  Ms. Zimmerman, you may proceed.

            3               MS. ZIMMERMAN:  Thank you, Your Honor.

            4     BY MS. ZIMMERMAN:

            5     Q.  Dr. Elghobashi, before we took a break, you were I think

            6     preparing to explain to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury

            7     how the supercomputer has generated videos summarizing the

            8     work you did in this case.  Is that right?

            9     A.  Correct.

           10     Q.  And I'm going to turn your attention here, this is

           11     Plaintiffs' Exhibit 1612, slide 18, and it's a -- do you

           12     know what this is, Doctor?  Is this one of your videos?  Do

           13     you recognize the video, Doctor?

           14     A.  Yes.  I'm sorry, I was not listening.  Yeah.

           15     Q.  That's okay.  And is this a video of your LES simulation

           16     with the Bair Hugger off?

           17     A.  Correct.

           18     Q.  All right.  And I'm going to hit play, and if you can

           19     explain to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what they're

           20     seeing, that would be helpful.

           21     A.  So there is a view of the operating room where the ten

           22     grilles and the ceiling and four grilles near the floor and

           23     operating table with four medical staff.  The yellow, the

           24     green, the red right now it's spreading but originally they

           25     were in a U shape around the operating table.  Each color


                                
                                                       
                                                                             888



            1     has one million squames.  And what you see in time in the

            2     trajectories or where each individual squame is at a given

            3     time, now you see all the spreading and turbulent mixing

            4     allows them to cross, go from right to left, because the

            5     eddies can go any way depending on flow conditions in there.

            6     Q.  And what, if anything, from this video, is relevant to

            7     your opinion about the movement of particles in an operating

            8     room?

            9     A.  Oh, I think you can see that none of the squames reached

           10     higher than the shoulder of the medical staff, sometimes

           11     near the waist.  Of course we have other visualization that

           12     we, routine, that shape to see exactly the details, but this

           13     is one of the -- one of the angles.  I think in an original

           14     report there were different angles.

           15     Q.  All right.  And did the supercomputer generate multiple

           16     videos for you?

           17     A.  If you wish, you can ask -- you can run a visualization

           18     program that takes the data from LES in a given period of

           19     time to create a video, yes.

           20     Q.  Okay.  And did you also have some of these videos made

           21     to show what the effect is with the Bair Hugger on?

           22     A.  Correct.  That will be this one here.  Before it starts,

           23     you can see the yellow, green, and that's the initial

           24     position of the squames before we turned the Bair Hugger on,

           25     yes.


                                
                                                       
                                                                             889



            1     Q.  So each of these -- each of the colors on the bottom,

            2     those are -- those represent squames?

            3     A.  Each color is one million squames.

            4     Q.  And are they -- are they --

            5     A.  The -- excuse me.  But the squames, think of a little

            6     water droplet, the size is about ten microns.  And usual

            7     human hair, if you look at one of your hairs, it's about a

            8     hundred microns, one tenth of a millimeter.  This is one

            9     tenth of a human hair approximately.  Of course hair can

           10     have different sizes.  So these are tiny particles and their

           11     density is like water because people know, the human body

           12     has 75 percent water, so when you shed skin squames, these

           13     have the same density as water, yeah.

           14     Q.  And each of the squames is ten microns in your --

           15     A.  Correct.

           16     Q.  -- model?

           17     A.  Correct.

           18     Q.  All right.  And then this is the video of the Bair

           19     Hugger model 505 on?

           20     A.  Right, yes.

           21     Q.  And what do you see here?

           22     A.  The squames rise at a higher level than the previous

           23     video, and you can see that, very obvious.

           24     Q.  The people in your video are not moving.  Is that right?

           25     A.  Correct.


                                
                                                       
                                                                             890



            1     Q.  All right.  What impact, if any, would there be if the

            2     people were moving?

            3     A.  It would be much worse.  I mean, I summarize first, all

            4     the simulation we did, we did everything in the simulation

            5     to provide the best case scenario for 3M, not for us.  I

            6     wanted the best case scenario.  I wanted to see, put

            7     everything on the floor, because in general, in a operating

            8     room, the squames are everywhere.  We could have put them

            9     one meter high, two meter, we put them near the ceiling,

           10     then they will drop, but we did not do that.  We put, again,

           11     best case scenario for 3M.  So these came from the floor up

           12     only if the Bair Hugger is on, yeah.

           13     Q.  Doctor, as you were preparing your work in this case,

           14     did you review an article by Dr. Memarzadeh?  Does that name

           15     familiar?

           16     A.  A long time ago, just somebody told me there is a person

           17     at NIH who did something and related.  I looked at it and I

           18     think he was using RANS, R-A-N-S, which, as I described

           19     earlier, is the lowest level of simulation, means

           20     untrustworthy for this load.  You can use RANS for a garden

           21     hose, that's okay, but you use it for this, that's bad, bad

           22     idea.

           23     Q.  Doctor, do you remember what size particles

           24     Dr. Memarzadeh --

           25     A.  Ten microns.


                                
                                                       
                                                                             891



            1     Q.  The same size you used?

            2     A.  Yes.

            3     Q.  And he used the RANS model.  Is that right?

            4     A.  Yes.

            5     Q.  Did Dr. Memarzadeh include a drape in his --

            6     A.  No.

            7     Q.  And what impact, if any, does that have on the results?

            8     A.  Well, we tried to put everything in the operating room

            9     as I saw it by myself in the Santa Monica operating room.

           10     That's the nurse told us this is how we do orthopedic

           11     surgery, so I followed that.

           12     Q.  Do you know, did Dr. Memarzadeh, did he conclude that

           13     particles reached the surgical site as well?

           14     A.  I could not hear what you said.

           15     Q.  I'm sorry, I'm not speaking into the microphone.

           16     A.  Oh, okay.  Okay.

           17     Q.  Let me direct you, the book in front of you, Plaintiffs'

           18     Exhibit 1419, page 3.

           19     A.  Yes.

           20     Q.  And the first full paragraph, did you start out

           21     discussing Dr. Memarzadeh's work?

           22     A.  Correct.

           23     Q.  Do you know how -- he used a RANS model.  Is that right?

           24     A.  Correct.

           25     Q.  Do you know how many particles he modeled?


                                
                                                       
                                                                             892



            1     A.  I don't remember, maybe 3,000.  It could be written here

            2     somewhere.

            3     Q.  4,000 sound right?

            4     A.  4,000, okay.

            5               MR. BLACKWELL:  Objection, Your Honor.  Leading.

            6               THE COURT:  It is.

            7               MS. ZIMMERMAN:  All right.

            8     BY MS. ZIMMERMAN:

            9     Q.  The fifth line down in the first full paragraph.

           10     A.  Okay.  Yes.

           11     Q.  And I'm going to direct your attention about midway

           12     through the paragraph.

           13     A.  Yeah.

           14     Q.  And your paper says, it's the sentence starts out they.

           15     Do you see that?

           16     A.  Yeah, they, the first word in the sentence they, upper

           17     case they.

           18     Q.  Could you read that to the ladies and gentlemen of the

           19     jury?

           20     A.  They showed that roughly 2 percent to 5 percent of

           21     particles reach the surgical site, and in italics, provided

           22     they are originated very close, about 1.3 centimeter above

           23     the site, yes.

           24     Q.  Okay.  And your particles started where?

           25     A.  On the floor, yeah.  We avoided anything, yeah.


                                
                                                       
                                                                             893



            1     Q.  Did Dr. Memarzadeh's group use a drape?

            2     A.  I don't think so, no.

            3     Q.  Okay.  And why -- why might a drape matter?

            4     A.  Again, go back to Santa Monica hospital, we had to do

            5     the conditions in a operating room identical to what happens

            6     in reality when you have a surgery, so I did not omit

            7     anything, except some insignificant machines, computers and

            8     things which are not really important.

            9     Q.  Okay.  Tell me about that, Doctor.  You -- have you seen

           10     pictures of the operating room that was where Mr. Gareis's

           11     surgery took place?

           12     A.  I think the during the deposition the counsel of 3M

           13     showed me photographs of a operating room called Providence.

           14     I don't know what it is.  But he showed me the machines and

           15     yes.

           16     Q.  Okay.  And, in your model, did you include a patient?

           17     A.  Include a patient?

           18     Q.  Yes.

           19     A.  Yes.

           20     Q.  Did -- what about a surgical team?

           21     A.  We have four, four surgical team people.

           22     Q.  What other equipment did you use in your model?

           23     A.  Well, the Bair Hugger surgical masks, and that's it.

           24     Q.  There have been some questions to other witnesses about

           25     other devices used in that operating room.  Do you know what


                                
                                                       
                                                                             894



            1     a electrocautery device is?

            2     A.  Say it again, please.

            3     Q.  Yes.  Do you know what a electrocautery device is?

            4     A.  Yes.  Yes, I do.

            5     Q.  Okay.  And is that used throughout the course of a

            6     operation?

            7     A.  No, it's a intermittent device.  You use it for a few

            8     seconds to close a wound and that's it.

            9     Q.  And what import, if any, is the fact that the device is

           10     used intermittently, what impact does that have on the

           11     opinions that you have in this case?

           12     A.  Well, in our project, we are interested in fact of hot

           13     air relieving the Bair Hugger and the drape on the motion of

           14     squames in the room.  And a machine like you just mentioned

           15     had no effect or insignificant effect on that behavior.

           16     Q.  All right.  Do you -- do you know how many watts, for

           17     example, an electrocautery device generates?

           18     A.  I think about maybe 300-watt maybe or 300 to 500,

           19     depends, yeah.

           20     Q.  Do you know about anesthesia, how many watts the

           21     anesthesia machine emits?

           22     A.  Yeah, they're all about a hundred watts, much lower than

           23     the hair dryer in your bathroom, much lower, and

           24     intermittently used.

           25     Q.  And they are more or less watts than the Bair Hugger


                                
                                                       
                                                                             895



            1     machine?

            2     A.  They're all below the Bair Hugger machine, yes.

            3     Q.  You have another video I think from a different angle?

            4     A.  Yes.

            5     Q.  Can you explain to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury

            6     what they're going to see in this video?

            7     A.  It's a close-up on the previous video to show when the

            8     Bair Hugger is on, how the different color squames would

            9     rise or where would they go, yes.

           10     Q.  How do you validate the work that you do?  How is CFD

           11     validated?

           12     A.  That's a good question.  So if there is a simple flow,

           13     you can run an experiment using noninvasive -- I'll go back

           14     a little bit.  If you want to provide measurement in a

           15     turbulent flow, you cannot put your hand in it because that

           16     would be invasive to the flow.  You cannot do that.

           17     Q.  If you reached your hand in, it would interrupt the

           18     results?

           19     A.  Yeah, putting whatever device was suggested by other

           20     people, you cannot do that, so it has to be noninvasive,

           21     means you have to use optical devices, laser beams.  And you

           22     can spend a long time to be trained of how to use it.  You

           23     have to at least a Ph.D., at least, and use these optical 3D

           24     like PIV particle image velocimetry and you need access to

           25     that operating room for two months, at least, and one month


                                
                                                       
                                                                             896



            1     to process the data.  You need highly qualified people.  And

            2     this will be the nearest thing to an LES.  Then you can go.

            3     It costs minimum $2 million, in addition to having access to

            4     operating room for two months.  Nobody should enter in

            5     because the optical equipment has to be set up.  In the

            6     absence of this, then you have to go back to your code and

            7     see if it was validated in other flows, and that what's we

            8     did.

            9     Q.  Okay.  So let me ask you, so did you do -- did you use a

           10     PIV to validate your work here?

           11     A.  I did not.  You need very specialized people.  The best

           12     person I know, there are two or three people in the company,

           13     one at Caltech, one at Arizona, yeah, so you have to get

           14     those people with their post docs and Ph.D. and pay them

           15     quite a bit of money and in addition to buying

           16     four-dimensional cameras and then you can do that.

           17     Q.  Okay.  So you didn't do PIV here.  Is your work still

           18     validated?

           19     A.  Absolutely.  Because that code was validated over

           20     15 years, at least 15 years at Stanford University where the

           21     code was created.  And that goes through testing like

           22     testing plain, simple flows, more difficult, until you do

           23     something like the flow inside the shift engine combustor

           24     for Pratt & Whitney or Rolls-Royce you do that.  After you

           25     do all this means you solve a energy equation and more and


                                
                                                       
                                                                             897



            1     other equations or chemistry, then you know your code is

            2     fine, then you can use it for simpler flow like this one.

            3     The operating rooms are much simpler flow than the flow

            4     inside a combustion chamber of a jet engine that you fly

            5     because that combustion chamber is very liquid filled, in

            6     different sizes, and much higher temperature, 2,000 degrees

            7     centigrade, and swirling, highly complex.  If the code can

            8     predict that to satisfaction of the manufacturer of the jet

            9     engine, then when you go to an operating room, then you know

           10     it's fine, yeah.

           11     Q.  So if the code has been validated for more complicated

           12     problems --

           13     A.  Yes.

           14     Q.  -- it's also valid for --

           15     A.  Yes.  Yes.

           16     Q.  -- less complicated problems?

           17               MR. BLACKWELL:  Objection, Your Honor.

           18               THE WITNESS:  Remember validation takes many

           19     years.  First you do very simple flow, LES and a pi flow,

           20     then a channel flow, then a cavity flow.  You can do, there

           21     are many scenarios which I think I summarized in my year ago

           22     to I think it was sent to the counsel of 3M.  So validation,

           23     it's published in peer-reviewed papers.  Stanford have the

           24     best group in the world.  It's called Center for Turbulence

           25     Research, the whole thing is called Center for Turbulence


                                
                                                       
                                                                             898



            1     Research, it's the only one in the world, and it produces

            2     Dr. Apte and many other good people, yeah.

            3     BY MS. ZIMMERMAN:

            4     Q.  All right.  And you had one more video in your

            5     PowerPoint here to show to the ladies and gentlemen of the

            6     jury.  What is this?

            7     A.  It's a zoomed in on the area of the knee on the

            8     operating table, and the blue cube is just to tell you what

            9     is focussing on that area.  And you see the -- some red

           10     squames and some yellow squames approaching that area.

           11     Q.  All right.  And about how much time is lapsing in these

           12     videos, if you remember?

           13     A.  This is for the 505?

           14     Q.  Yes.

           15     A.  So it took 45 seconds, approximately.  I'm not -- yeah,

           16     45 seconds.

           17     Q.  All right.  And then this image on the screen in front

           18     of you, what is -- what is this that you're seeing?

           19     A.  It shows in the neighborhood of the knee there are some

           20     squames, I cannot count them, but we have a plot to show how

           21     many of them, and some red that shows you the squames come

           22     from everywhere, anywhere, because different colors here,

           23     that the reason for selecting colors I wanted to know in the

           24     beginning where do they come from and yeah.

           25     Q.  All right.  And what does, on the bottom corner there,


                                
                                                       
                                                                             899



            1     what does T equals 36s mean?

            2     A.  Where is that?  I can't see it.

            3     Q.  My fingers aren't skinny enough to write on there.

            4     A.  I think this is, yeah, 36 seconds, yes.

            5     Q.  Okay.

            6     A.  36 seconds.  That's like a little bit over half a

            7     minute.

            8     Q.  Okay.  Doctor, do you know if 3M has done a validation

            9     study with PIV?

           10     A.  No, definitely not.

           11     Q.  And do you know if Dr. Memarzadeh did use PIV?

           12     A.  No.  By the way, if anybody in the world has a PIV

           13     measurements of operating room, I would have looked at this

           14     first look before I do any computations first.  And I tell

           15     the students as well, look for the experimental data that

           16     you're going to compare with to validate.  That's number

           17     one, before doing anything.  In this case, I knew there was

           18     nothing so we have to do it on our own.

           19     Q.  Okay.  Doctor, would Schlieren imaging be applicable to

           20     understanding particle movement in this case?

           21     A.  Schlieren, right?

           22     Q.  Schlieren.

           23     A.  Okay.  Schlieren is the technique, it started in

           24     Germany, the word Schlieren in Germany means it's tweaks,

           25     and it basically it measures density gradients in a flow.


                                
                                                       
                                                                             900



            1     It is useful for you to visualize things like if you put a

            2     candle and you do Schlieren optics, you can see the hot part

            3     which would be near the edge of the candle, the cold part in

            4     the other room, and that would be dark and light colored

            5     because streaks, that's how Schlieren optics does.

            6               It's very useful for people who study bullets

            7     coming out of a gun for bullet designers like U.S. Army and

            8     things like that, they can see because bullets will be

            9     traveling at high-speed, super, mach number two or three,

           10     they can see precisely where the marking angles are.

           11               Other than that, Schlieren does not give you any

           12     quantity of data.  Schlieren can't give you the temperature

           13     or the velocity or anything.  It's just good to visualize

           14     flows if you are interested, yes.

           15     Q.  Can you visualize particles with a Schlieren?

           16     A.  No.  Because if the particles are not -- if the

           17     particles are the same temperature at the room, then you see

           18     nothing because no temperature gradients.  You need density

           19     gradients, yes.

           20     Q.  Doctor, do particles follow streamlines?

           21     A.  No.

           22     Q.  Why not?

           23     A.  Okay.  Basically they're not -- streamlines, a

           24     streamline is defined for undergraduate, second year

           25     undergraduate.  It's a line tangent to the velocity vector


                                
                                                       
                                                                             901



            1     at a particular point.  That's it.  Particles have their own

            2     trajectory.  They do not follow streamline, never.  So a

            3     streamline is if you want to look at streamlines, that's

            4     fine.  If that's your hobby, they can do that.  If you want

            5     to run something, that's, especially in a turbulent flow,

            6     streamlines in a turbulent flow do not mean anything because

            7     you would be time averaging, it would be like crayons.  If

            8     you see nice clean streamlines, that means you are using

            9     RANS or some funny stuff.

           10     Q.  All right.  Do streamlines take into account the little

           11     eddies?

           12     A.  No.

           13     Q.  Doctor, are you familiar with ANSYS or Fluent?

           14     A.  Yes.

           15     Q.  What are those?

           16     A.  Okay.  Fluent is the name of a software purchased by a

           17     company called ANSYS.  The original code was built, the

           18     numerical code was built at Imperial College in 1972 when I

           19     was a Ph.D. student.  So our group, we were 35 Ph.D.

           20     students, we were working to develop a code that people in,

           21     like, Rolls-Royce can use.  That code later was taken by a

           22     professor in Sheffield, sold to a company called Creare in

           23     New Hampshire and ANSYS bought that company.  So they

           24     have -- so I know exactly what's in behind it.  It's

           25     basically a code for those people who do not know -- who do


                                
                                                       
                                                                             902



            1     not want to know what's inside the black box, they push

            2     buttons, you want leminar flow, push yellow, turbulent flow,

            3     push red, so nobody of high academic standard was Fluent in

            4     research.  Fluent is basically a tool used for companies who

            5     cannot pay salaries of Ph.D. engineers to use with people

            6     who have a bachelor's degree or a master's degree.

            7     Q.  Doctor, can ANSYS provide an accurate solution to the

            8     problem about what impact, if any, the Bair Hugger machine

            9     has on a operating room?

           10     A.  If you do not know what the black box is doing in the

           11     computation tags, then it's a guesswork.  And I would

           12     never -- I mean, I would advise my students, nobody in

           13     academia use, nobody, as far as I know, means Stanford,

           14     Caltech, University of California, Johns Hopkins, Harvard,

           15     nobody, it is only for those people who do not create their

           16     own codes, the cheapest way to do is run Fluent.  You can

           17     get the license, like software, Microsoft, and use it, but

           18     that's -- you cannot -- you cannot teach people research

           19     using Fluent.  I use it only for undergraduate students who

           20     do not know numerical, nothing, so they can get a job in

           21     industry quickly because industry likes students who know

           22     Fluent, but it doesn't mean they know much about numerical

           23     method, yeah.

           24     Q.  Okay.  Doctor, I expect the jury may hear some testimony

           25     about using the Boussinesq --


                                
                                                       
                                                                             903



            1     A.  Yes.

            2     Q.  -- approach.  What is that?

            3     A.  So you've seen the creation on the screen before.  Can

            4     we see it again, please?

            5     Q.  Sure.

            6     A.  Okay.  On the far left there's a symbol called rho,

            7     that's a greek letter, and in science we use that for

            8     density.  So density of the air which is one kilogram per

            9     meter cube, that's rho.  The way I wrote Navier-Stokes here

           10     because it was written for people who are not experts in

           11     Fluent mechanics, that rho should be in each term inside the

           12     brackets, that tab, because the density and velocity change

           13     in a operating room and each location, each instant.  And

           14     that takes computation of time and money.

           15               In 1890, there was a French scientist called

           16     Boussinesq and he said this is so complex, I want to get an

           17     easier solution, so I took this rho, divide each term by

           18     rho, so and you can assuming it's a constant, but there is a

           19     term which is not here and because, again, I was giving a

           20     lecture to a general audience, that there is a term on the

           21     far right should be minus G which the gravitation.  That

           22     means if you have a hot fluid and cold fluid in a given

           23     location, that term would allow the hot and the warmer fluid

           24     to rise and the colder fluids to go down.

           25               That term is not here because, again, I was giving


                                
                                                       
                                                                             904



            1     a lecture to a general audience.  So Boussinesq, if you

            2     divide everything by rho, you get that, the term, and the

            3     very end will be minus G divided by rho with some other rho

            4     connected to it.  And the -- and he doesn't care about

            5     density variation in anywhere, only near the hot particle.

            6     That means if you have an operating room and hot air near

            7     the drape is here and moving to another place near the bed,

            8     Boussinesq does not care about it.  He only cares about the

            9     location where the hot air rises or goes down.

           10               It's called Boussinesq.  Nobody should use

           11     Boussinesq approximation in this type of environment.

           12     Usually people use it in oceanography because they have a

           13     large ocean and you have layers of ocean, cold and hot, they

           14     use Boussinesq, that's acceptable.  But to use it in a

           15     operating room or in a jet engine is just unacceptable.

           16     It's rubbish.

           17     Q.  Does -- Doctor, does the Boussinesq, does it solve for

           18     particles?

           19     A.  No, this is in 1850, he had no idea about these things

           20     yet.

           21     Q.  Doctor, earlier I asked you if you would -- if you were

           22     going to hold the opinions that you offered to the jury

           23     today to a reasonable degree of engineering certainty.  Do

           24     you remember that?

           25     A.  Yes.


                                
                                                       
                                                                             905



            1     Q.  Does that mean greater than 50 percent to you?

            2     A.  You mean my confidence in the results we produced?

            3     Q.  Yes, sir.

            4     A.  99 percent.

            5     Q.  Okay.  Now, you -- you had a number of other videos that

            6     were produced by the supercomputer.  Is that right?

            7     A.  Yes, but I don't have -- I don't know which one you're

            8     trying to do.

            9     Q.  All right.  Can we have plaintiffs' 1462?

           10               Doctor, do you recognize this?

           11     A.  Yes.

           12     Q.  What is this?

           13     A.  It is supposed to be a grid view showing the

           14     velocity -- the velocity changes at a given location in

           15     time, right, we call it velocity contours, for example, yes,

           16     around -- looking at the operating table from where the

           17     anesthesia machine is or where the Bair Hugger is, if you're

           18     looking towards the feet of the patient, yeah.

           19     Q.  Okay.  So is it looking as if you're standing at the

           20     head of a patient?

           21     A.  At the head, yes, correct, next to the head, yes.

           22     Q.  All right.  And what are the -- what are these white

           23     areas?  What's that?

           24     A.  This, the part is the drape, the drape is hanging to be

           25     like that, uh-huh.


                                
                                                       
                                                                             906



            1     Q.  And is this something that the supercomputer\generated

            2     for you as a part of the CFD you did?

            3     A.  You mean, the videos are not were the supercomputer --

            4     Q.  Yes.  Sorry?

            5     A.  The video, yes.

            6               MS. ZIMMERMAN:  Your Honor, we'd offer Plaintiffs'

            7     Exhibit 1440 -- this 1462.

            8               MR. BLACKWELL:  Your Honor, no objection for

            9     demonstrative purposes.

           10               THE COURT:  On that basis, it is received.

           11         (Exhibit P-1462 is received as a demonstrative.)

           12               MS. ZIMMERMAN:  We'd offer it as substantive

           13     evidence in the case as well.

           14               THE COURT:  We'll take that up later.

           15               MS. ZIMMERMAN:  Okay.

           16     BY MS. ZIMMERMAN:

           17     Q.  Can you play that?  And Doctor, could you explain to the

           18     jury what the individual is showing here?

           19     A.  It will show now when the Bair Hugger is on the heat and

           20     air relief the drape, and if the temperature leaving the

           21     drape is higher than the surrounding, then the density would

           22     be lower, therefore, it will rise up until it meets the air

           23     coming from the ceiling.  By the way, if you look at the

           24     ceiling, you see two rivers.  These are high-speed flow

           25     coming from the ceiling.  And then when the heat and air


                                
                                                       
                                                                             907



            1     rises, it will meet the incoming air and when -- when two

            2     fluids meet in an opposite direction, they create something

            3     called stagnation zone, the velocity stops, becomes zero

            4     until the fluid goes around it, as you can see here.  So

            5     yes, so that's what it is.

            6     Q.  All right.

            7     A.  And you see eddies in the room and on the right and on

            8     the left.

            9     Q.  And can you indicate for the jury on the screen where

           10     the eddies are?

           11     A.  Oh, okay.  Like this one here and here, yeah, these are

           12     all different size eddies.  So you can see in a operating

           13     room that's turbulent flow.  In a laminar flow, you'd never

           14     see that.

           15     Q.  And are there any laminar flow operating rooms?

           16     A.  No, as far as I know, I mean, yes.

           17     Q.  All right.  I'd also like to bring up Plaintiffs'

           18     Exhibit 1464.  Do you recognize this as well, doctor?

           19     A.  Right.

           20     Q.  And what is this?

           21     A.  It's a similar video to the one before.

           22     Q.  All right.  And, again, showing --

           23     A.  Velocity contours and the flow coming from the ceiling

           24     and going down and the drape is both sides of the bed, and

           25     we're looking at from the direction of the head of the


                                
                                                       
                                                                             908



            1     patient.

            2     Q.  And this is something that you generated as part of the

            3     work that you've done in this case.  Is that right?

            4     A.  Correct.

            5               MS. ZIMMERMAN:  Plaintiffs would offer Plaintiff

            6     Exhibit 1464 as well.

            7               MR. BLACKWELL:  No objection, Your Honor, again,

            8     for demonstrative purposes.

            9               THE COURT:  And it's received on that basis.

           10         (Exhibit P1464 is received as a demonstrative.)

           11               MS. ZIMMERMAN:  We will renew our request to admit

           12     it for substantive evidence at the Court's discretion.

           13     BY MS. ZIMMERMAN:

           14     Q.  What is -- can we play the video?

           15               What is this video showing, Dr. Elghobashi?

           16     A.  Similar to the one before, the fluid, hot fluid is

           17     rising from the edges of the drape until it meets the

           18     incoming air from the ceiling.

           19     Q.  1465, please.  And do you recognize this as well,

           20     Doctor?

           21     A.  Correct, yes.

           22     Q.  And you had a number of these videos generated.  Is that

           23     right?

           24     A.  Correct.

           25     Q.  Do you want to go ahead and play that one?


                                
                                                       
                                                                             909



            1               And Doctor, what are the -- what are the graph

            2     lines on the side, what do those represent?

            3     A.  Okay.  So these will be the distances along the room,

            4     like in meters, so a meter is about three feet, so you can

            5     go -- oh, it's black now.  It's gone.

            6               So the numbers on the bottom, so it will -- if you

            7     add the both sides from the zero, you get about seven meter

            8     which the width of the room, the height of the room, three

            9     meters, which is about ten feet, approximately.

           10     Q.  So tell the --

           11     A.  So this is the cross-section in the room, a given

           12     location.  We select a -- excuse me.  We select a certain

           13     plains to show -- to show the results.  But, of course, we

           14     could have made hundreds and thousands of plains, but we

           15     just selected something to show you what's happening.

           16     Q.  And you generated maybe a dozen videos.  Is that about

           17     right?

           18     A.  More actually, yeah, but, yeah, about that, mm-hmm.

           19     Q.  Doctor, do you stand by the work that you've done in

           20     this matter?  Do you stand by the work that you've done in

           21     this case?

           22     A.  Of course, yes, definitely.  I would not present

           23     anything if I don't stand by it.

           24     Q.  That's all I have.

           25     A.  We always say to the student, can you defend that result


                                
                                                       
                                                                             910



            1     in court, and if he said no, we do that for a hundred years,

            2     yeah.

            3     Q.  Okay.  Thank you, Doctor.

            4     A.  Okay.

            5               THE COURT:  All right.  Mr. Blackwell.

            6               MR. BLACKWELL:  Yes, Your Honor.  May I approach,

            7     Your Honor?

            8               THE COURT:  You may.

            9                          CROSS-EXAMINATION

           10     BY MR. BLACKWELL:

           11     Q.  Good afternoon, Dr. Elghobashi.

           12     A.  Good afternoon.

           13     Q.  My name is Jerry Blackwell, and we had a chance to meet

           14     for the first time this morning?

           15     A.  Yes.

           16     Q.  We shook hands, and I told you we'd get a chance to get

           17     better acquainted real soon?

           18     A.  Yes, sir.

           19     Q.  And here we are.  I'd like to start with your 99 percent

           20     statement.

           21     A.  Yes.

           22     Q.  And another statement you made which was if you have the

           23     wrong boundary conditions, you're going to get a different

           24     conclusion?

           25     A.  Correct.


                                
                                                       
                                                                              911



            1     Q.  Remember saying that?

            2     A.  Absolutely.

            3     Q.  That means you can have an absolutely perfect

            4     supercomputer\but if you have the wrong boundary conditions,

            5     even with a perfect supercomputer, you can get a different

            6     conclusion, right?

            7     A.  Correct.

            8     Q.  You can have an absolutely perfect set of codes --

            9     A.  Yes.

           10     Q.  -- but if you have the wrong boundary conditions --

           11     A.  Right.

           12     Q.  -- you'll get a different conclusion?

           13     A.  Yes.

           14     Q.  You can have perfectly, a perfect supercomputer, perfect

           15     codes, and with the wrong assumptions, you can have a

           16     hurricane make landfall in Minnesota?

           17     A.  Possibly.

           18     Q.  And so there is nothing about having valid codes or a

           19     perfect supercomputer that validates the outcome of a CFD.

           20     Isn't that true?

           21     A.  Could you repeat the question again?

           22     Q.  Yes.  There is nothing at all about having a perfect

           23     supercomputer or perfect codes that validates the results of

           24     the CFD per se.  Isn't that true?

           25     A.  I disagree.  You're -- all I can say, again, repeatedly,


                                
                                                       
                                                                              912



            1     if you change the boundary conditions for the same

            2     equations, you get different results.

            3     Q.  That is my question, sir, that if you have a perfectly

            4     valid code and improper assumptions, then you will get a

            5     different result even with perfect codes.  Isn't that true?

            6     A.  Okay.  If you change the boundary conditions with a

            7     perfect code, you get different results.

            8     Q.  That's true, isn't it?

            9     A.  Yes.  I just said, yes.

           10     Q.  Now, let me bring this home to Mr. Gareis.

           11     Incidentally, do you know who Mr. Gareis is?

           12     A.  I have no idea.

           13     Q.  All right.  So you've -- you have never met the

           14     plaintiff in this case?

           15     A.  No idea.  I don't know if he's here or not.

           16     Q.  Well, he is.  He's right there, him and his wife.

           17     A.  That's the first time I seen.  I have no idea, yeah.

           18     Q.  Now, do you understand that this particular case and

           19     trial is about what these lawyers say happened to

           20     Mr. Gareis?

           21     A.  I really don't know.  All I know is I was asked to do

           22     simulation of an operating room as accurately as possible

           23     and I did.  I have no idea about the litigation or I know

           24     just 3M versus this, but I know what it is, but I don't know

           25     people, I don't know persons, I don't know anything.


                                
                                                       
                                                                              913



            1     Q.  Well, let me ask you if you know operating room No. 4

            2     which is the operating room in which the surgery took place

            3     at issue in this trial at Providence Hospital Northeast in

            4     Columbia, South Carolina.  Do you know that operating room,

            5     yes or no, sir?

            6     A.  I repeat the word no.  The first time I know about

            7     Providence No. 4 room was in the deposition in California a

            8     few months ago and the lawyer, Mr., I think the name is

            9     Goss, G-O-S-S, showed me a drawing of the room and said this

           10     is Providence and showed me photographs.

           11     Q.  We're going to come to that in a little bit.

           12     A.  Yes.

           13     Q.  But I just want to establish on the front end that to

           14     the extent you have done a CFD that the lawyers claim

           15     pertains to this case, you did not do a CFD that was

           16     specific to operating room No. 4 where Mr. Gareis's surgery

           17     took place.  That's a true statement, isn't it?  Yes or no,

           18     sir.

           19     A.  Okay.  It's a true statement, but I'd like to modify

           20     what you said, if you allow me.

           21     Q.  Well, they'll have an opportunity --

           22     A.  Okay.

           23     Q.  -- to ask you questions.

           24     A.  Okay.

           25     Q.  I want to try and keep us on somewhat --


                                
                                                       
                                                                              914



            1     A.  Sure.

            2     Q.  -- of a schedule.

            3     A.  Yeah.

            4     Q.  Okay.  Now, you told us before that to get to the

            5     initial assumptions or boundary conditions for this

            6     operating room, you went to what you described as a 3M video

            7     on YouTube.  Remember saying that?

            8     A.  Only to get the dimensions of the room.  We could have

            9     selected any room.  We just wanted to know what operating

           10     room size is that 3M used.

           11     Q.  Sir.

           12     A.  That's it.

           13     Q.  I'm just asking if you went to YouTube to get the

           14     information and you did, didn't you?

           15     A.  That's a general statement.  I -- I want to be precise.

           16     I went to 3M video to get seven meter by seven meter by

           17     three meter.  That's it.

           18     Q.  Now, to be precise, when you went to the 3M video and

           19     you took the dimension seven meter by seven meters by three

           20     meters, there wasn't anything in the 3M video that claimed

           21     that it represented the operating room where Mr. Gareis had

           22     his surgery.  Isn't that true?

           23     A.  Correct, never mentioned names of people.

           24     Q.  Well, you had no reason to think that picking up a video

           25     off of YouTube was reflective of Mr. Gareis's operating room


                                
                                                       
                                                                              915



            1     dimensions, did you, sir?

            2     A.  I mean, it's -- it's very obvious, the question.  I

            3     don't know what you're asking, but --

            4     Q.  I'll rephrase it.  When you went to the 3M video on

            5     YouTube, which you described as a 3M video that you said had

            6     dimensions of seven meters by seven meters by three meters,

            7     was there anything at all in that video that told you that

            8     those were, in fact, the dimensions of the operating room

            9     where Mr. Gareis had his surgery, sir, on November 9th,

           10     2010?

           11     A.  Nothing like that was mentioned in the page I saw, yes.

           12     Q.  On the page you saw, was there anything specifically or

           13     precisely mentioned that it in any way reflected the

           14     equipment that was, in fact, in Mr. Gareis's operating room

           15     on November 9th, 2010, sir?

           16     A.  No.

           17     Q.  Was there anything at all in the video in which it

           18     purported to represent the operating room personnel who

           19     would have been involved in Mr. Gareis's surgery on

           20     November 9th, 2010?

           21     A.  No.

           22     Q.  Now, when you went about the CFD, and we've seen the

           23     videos that you showed and how the different colored

           24     simulations of squames come up, and you spent quite a bit of

           25     time discussing that.  Remember?


                                
                                                       
                                                                              916



            1     A.  Correct.

            2     Q.  Now, did these lawyers ask you to do the same analysis

            3     with any other patient warming to see if the squames acted

            4     just the same?

            5     A.  No.

            6     Q.  Now, that's something with your expertise that you could

            7     have done had you been asked to do it, true?

            8     A.  Could you explain what you mean by other warming

            9     devices?

           10     Q.  Well, you focussed on the Bair Hugger.  Did she ask you

           11     to look at any other type?

           12     A.  You have to explain, if it's another air warming device,

           13     I -- no, I -- I didn't.

           14     Q.  All right.  So had they asked you to look at another air

           15     warming device and do exactly the same analysis that you did

           16     for the Bair Hugger, you could have done it.  Isn't that

           17     true?

           18     A.  That, it's obviously, I mean, I could have done anything

           19     if they asked me to do, I just -- they gave me Bair Hugger

           20     blanket, do that.

           21     Q.  So sir, when you say you could have done anything --

           22     A.  Not anything.  Any simulations in a operating room for

           23     that, yes.

           24     Q.  So under the heading of any other

           25     simulated -- simulations in the operating room, that means


                                
                                                       
                                                                              917



            1     had you been asked, you could have done simulations to see

            2     how the air and the heat from the anesthesia machine affects

            3     squames in operating rooms, couldn't you, sir?

            4     A.  Correct, yes.

            5     Q.  But you weren't asked to do that either, were you?

            6     A.  No.

            7     Q.  You could have done a simulation to look at how opening

            8     the operating room doors, open and closing them, open and

            9     closing them, during the surgery affected squames in

           10     operating room, couldn't you, sir?

           11     A.  As I repeated earlier, we did the best case scenario for

           12     3M because opening the door will enhance the dispersion of

           13     squames.  I know that based on my knowledge.  If I put

           14     another heating machine would have make it worse.  We gave

           15     you the best case scenario, trust me about this, trust me.

           16     Q.  Sir, my job is to ask you questions --

           17     A.  Okay.

           18     Q.  -- and to try and get at facts --

           19     A.  Yeah, okay.

           20     Q.  -- so it's not about trust or distrust.

           21     A.  Right.  No, trust me because I know what I did.

           22     Q.  And sir, or even about what you think was in the best

           23     case scenario for 3M, I want to talk about accurately what

           24     happened, what didn't happen, what things that could have

           25     been specifically done that weren't done.  So in that vein,


                                
                                                       
                                                                              918



            1     I want to ask you again, had you been asked to model, to

            2     simulate a CFD what happens when the operating rooms are

            3     opening and closing and people going in and out during

            4     Mr. Gareis's actual surgery, you could have modeled that by

            5     CFD had you been asked to do it.  Isn't that true?

            6     A.  Correct.

            7     Q.  But you weren't asked to do it?

            8     A.  Correct.

            9     Q.  Now, the last thing with respect to the 3M -- the 3M

           10     video that you looked at on YouTube, nothing in that video

           11     purported to represent what the turbulent flow was in

           12     Mr. Gareis's operating room on November 9th, 2010.  Isn't

           13     that true?

           14     A.  I repeat again, I looked at the video not to learn about

           15     turbulence, I don't know turbulence from videos, I know

           16     turbulence, I look at it to get the geometry of the room,

           17     period, seven meter, seven meter, three meter, period.

           18     Q.  So let me ask my question one more time just so we're

           19     all clear.  Nothing in the 3M video that you saw on YouTube

           20     purported to represent or reflect the turbulent flow that

           21     took place in Mr. Gareis's operating room on November 9th,

           22     2010.  Isn't that true?  If you can answer yes or no.

           23     A.  Can I make life easier for both of us?  The video on 3M

           24     showed only the geometry.  I did not go to video to learn

           25     about turbulence.  I've been doing this for 50 years.  I


                                
                                                       
                                                                              919



            1     don't go to videos to learn.  I only wanted the geometry.

            2     Q.  Sir, I'm not trying to offend you or even frustrate you.

            3     I'm just trying to understand what the video reported to

            4     show that you took away.  You took dimensions from it, I

            5     understand that, and but there wasn't anything in it where

            6     3M said this video purports to show the turbulent flow that

            7     would have been found in Mr. Gareis's operating room on

            8     November 9th, 2010, at the time of his surgery.  That's a

            9     fair statement, isn't it?

           10     A.  The answer is zero, to all your questions.  Zero.

           11     Nothing.

           12     Q.  Right.  Nothing in the video you mean?

           13     A.  Right.  I mean, it's -- I repeat it so many times.  I

           14     only went to the geometry.

           15     Q.  Now, sir, let me go back to the beginning.  We did just

           16     hear and understand that you literally just met Mr. Gareis

           17     just moments ago while I'm standing here.  The model you

           18     did, the CFD, it was a model that was simulating particles

           19     or squames, true?

           20     A.  I -- I want to make a statement so then you can ask me,

           21     the -- it's not a model.  It's a computations of the fluid

           22     flow in an operating room, including the dispersion of

           23     squames in the room.

           24     Q.  It's a simulation, isn't it?

           25     A.  The -- the name of the methods called large eddy


                                
                                                       
                                                                              920



            1     simulation.  Therefore, it's obvious it has a simulation,

            2     yes.

            3     Q.  Well, my question, I apologize if it's obvious, is that

            4     if it's simulating particles, the fact is it's not meant to

            5     simulate bacteria.  Isn't that true?

            6     A.  That's correct.

            7     Q.  Now, your, sir, I think we established you're not a

            8     medical doctor and you don't have medical --

            9     A.  Definitely, I am not a medical doctor, definitely.

           10     Q.  And so can we agree, then, that you're not claiming that

           11     your CFD tells us either how or when Mr. Gareis was

           12     infected?

           13     A.  Absolutely not.

           14     Q.  Let's switch gears and talk about something different.

           15     I want to talk about a little bit a timeline in this case,

           16     and, generally, I want to talk to you about the what I call

           17     the scientific method.

           18     A.  Okay.

           19     Q.  And you're a scientist, obviously, sir.  Now, as a

           20     scientist, do you agree that you should make every effort to

           21     be objective in your research?

           22     A.  That's the name of the game.

           23     Q.  And the name of the game, with you being objective in

           24     your research, is to follow the scientific facts to a

           25     scientific conclusion wherever it leads?


                                
                                                       
                                                                              921



            1     A.  Absolutely.

            2     Q.  And so you don't start off with a conclusion and then

            3     use your expertise to find the science to support your

            4     preconceived conclusion, do you?

            5     A.  I said that before, we started -- I -- telling the

            6     counsel that if I find the results showing the squames do

            7     not rise to the table, I will report it this way because

            8     there are students career involved.  We are not doing

            9     commercial work.

           10     Q.  Fair enough.  But the point is, you don't start with a

           11     conclusion and then go out to prove it?

           12     A.  No scientist will start from -- nobody I know.

           13     Q.  All right.  And if anybody did that, you'd be critical

           14     of them, wouldn't you?

           15     A.  I would not consider them a scientist, first.

           16     Q.  All right.  So -- well, let's bring this back home to

           17     this case.  Now, you've prepared a CFD for the devices at

           18     issue in this case, the 505, sitting here on the floor.  We

           19     know that?

           20     A.  Yes.

           21     Q.  The lawyers here hired you to be involved in this around

           22     April of 2016?

           23     A.  I sometime in 2016.  I don't know the date exactly.  I

           24     can find out.

           25     Q.  Well, if I represent to you that it was April of 2016?


                                
                                                       
                                                                              922



            1     A.  That would be fine, yes.

            2     Q.  Will you argue with me?  So this is April 2016 you were

            3     hired and to address the CFD?

            4     A.  Correct.

            5     Q.  And the model 505.  Now, you completed your CFD and

            6     calculations on the model 505 in January or February of this

            7     year, didn't you?

            8     A.  I correct what you wrote.  When you asked me at the

            9     beginning it was the model 750.

           10     Q.  Right.  Okay.

           11     A.  750.  I did not do 505 in 2016.

           12     Q.  When were you asked to do the model 505?

           13     A.  Probably in 2017 or sometime toward the end of the year.

           14     I mean, I don't have my computer, it was calendar, I have a

           15     calendar that shows exactly, but I don't have it here.

           16     Approximately sometime 2017.

           17     Q.  Well, roughly when did you finish your calculations then

           18     for the model 750?

           19     A.  Could be March 2017, I think, March -- the -- the

           20     report.  But you have all the reports.  It's written on the

           21     date.  I -- I don't have anything here so.

           22     Q.  So I'll just say it was approximately March 2017

           23     completed calculations on 750, and then it would have been

           24     roughly in January or February of this year that you

           25     completed the calculations on the model 505?


                                
                                                       
                                                                              923



            1     A.  Right.  I mean, all these dates are fine with me, right,

            2     it doesn't bother me.  I just, if you want me to be

            3     accurate, I have to look at my calendar which I do not have

            4     here.

            5     Q.  You're -- the attorneys will correct it when they stand

            6     up.

            7     A.  Sure, that's fine.  I have no problem.  Just proceed.

            8     Q.  Because there is a thing that I want to ask you about.

            9     And now, were you then aware, presumably the lawyers are

           10     asking you to undertake this testing, the CFD, as a part of

           11     a scientific inquiry that relate to issues in this case?

           12     A.  Yes.

           13     Q.  That's a fair assumption, isn't it?

           14     A.  Yes.

           15     Q.  And are you aware that it was in December of 2016,

           16     before you had calculated any results before March 2017,

           17     that the lawyers in this case had already blamed the Bair

           18     Hugger?

           19     A.  I didn't hear the last sentence you said.

           20     Q.  That the lawyers in this case as of December 2016 had

           21     already blamed the Bair Hugger?

           22     A.  I have no clue.  I -- yeah, nobody told me anything,

           23     other than -- I was doing computations.

           24     Q.  Let me -- let me show you this.  I want to ask you about

           25     the plaintiff, we can pull up docket 1.  Now, the date on


                                
                                                       
                                                                              924



            1     this, as you can see across the top, is December 15th of

            2     2016 which is three months before you had even done your

            3     calculations on the model 750.  The lawyers were claiming

            4     that contaminates introduced into plaintiff's open surgical

            5     wound as a direct and proximate result of the use of the

            6     Bair Hugger during the subject surgery resulted in plaintiff

            7     developing a periprosthetic joint infection, PJI, also known

            8     as a deep joint infection, DJI.  The pathogen identified was

            9     MSSA.  Which stands for methicillin susceptible

           10     staphylococcus aureus.  Had you ever seen this before, sir?

           11     A.  Never.

           12     Q.  Did you the lawyers tell you that even while they were

           13     waiting for to you undertake your scientific inquiry, they

           14     were out ahead of you and went on to blame the Bair Hugger?

           15     Did they tell you that?

           16     A.  No, I -- yeah.

           17     Q.  Now, this statement that's made here that contaminants

           18     introduced into the wound resulted in the plaintiff

           19     developing a periprosthetic joint infection, did the lawyers

           20     point you to any studies to review?  You said you reviewed

           21     some studies at the start of this?

           22     A.  Right, right.  I didn't see -- I didn't see any studies.

           23     Q.  And so did they show you a single study that showed that

           24     the Bair Hugger actually increased bacteria over the

           25     surgical site?


                                
                                                       
                                                                              925



            1     A.  No.  Can I ask a question about this yellow part here?

            2     Could you tell me the date, when is the date of the

            3     document?

            4     Q.  Across the top, it's December 15th, 2016.

            5     A.  So the -- we submitted the report of the 750 in March

            6     but the results were already available in December.

            7     Q.  Do you know when?

            8     A.  I can't -- I don't have my computer here.  It's in the

            9     airplane place somewhere.  But I, in December, I'm -- in

           10     order to make a report, it took us, like, three months to

           11     write it.  So the results in December could have been

           12     available to them, but I didn't know about the yellow --

           13     Q.  Let me -- let me ask you another question, that's a

           14     curious thing about the scientific claims that are being

           15     made.  Did you ask the lawyers why, if they had actual

           16     in-the-field scientific proof that the Bair Hugger causes

           17     infections, why, if they had that, did they need to do a

           18     CFD?  Did you ask them that?

           19     A.  It is illogical for me as a scientist to ask somebody

           20     who's an expert in the law to tell me, you know, it doesn't

           21     make any sense.

           22     Q.  I'm just asking if you asked the question, Doctor.

           23     A.  They came to me, they told me this is the problem, could

           24     you help us.  I said I will think about it, and I did the

           25     work.  But I didn't ask them, did you -- I didn't ask them


                                
                                                       
                                                                              926



            1     these questions.

            2     Q.  All right.  Then I'll move on from here.  You were asked

            3     questions by counsel who was just here just about

            4     compensation for the work you've done --

            5     A.  Yes.

            6     Q.  -- with respect to this?

            7     A.  Yes.

            8     Q.  And you estimated it was roughly $200,000?

            9     A.  About that, yes.

           10     Q.  And would you argue with me if I told you the number was

           11     in excess of $255,000?

           12     A.  Could be.  I'm not a good businessman.  I never look at

           13     the checks or anything.  I just give the people who did the

           14     work --

           15     Q.  Well, you think making a quarter of a million dollars is

           16     pretty good business though, don't you, sir?

           17     A.  Not on that work.  That work, if it's done commercially

           18     with one place would have cost about 750.

           19     Q.  Now, in terms of the rates that you charge, am I correct

           20     that you charge $1,500 per hour or $10,000 for your trial

           21     testimony.  Is that right?

           22     A.  For this -- for this one today?

           23     Q.  Yes, sir.

           24     A.  I didn't think about it.  I really don't think about

           25     these things until I -- the work is done.  So for deposition


                                
                                                       
                                                                              927



            1     in the past of charge $1,500 an hour, yes.  In the past, not

            2     this one.  This could be much higher.

            3     Q.  Because you have to talk to me?  So do you know at this

            4     point, Dr. Elghobashi, if for your time you spend here

            5     today, whether you're charging them or do you not know the

            6     $1,500 per hour or is it $10,000 a day?  Do you know, sir?

            7     A.  I honestly never think about these things.  There's so

            8     many deadlines lines.  Yeah, okay.  I did not.

            9     Q.  Right.

           10     A.  I didn't tell them.  I didn't ask them for anything.

           11     Q.  So let me clear up just a couple of other things.  This

           12     was related to your having published an article related to

           13     your work in this case.  There were a couple of things I

           14     wanted to clarify.  You had made the statement that not all

           15     journals have high quality.  Remember saying that?  When we

           16     talked about --

           17     A.  In this here or --

           18     Q.  No, just in general.  You were talking about peer

           19     review?

           20     A.  Yeah.  Yes, yes, yes.

           21     Q.  And you said not all peer-reviewed journals have high

           22     quality?

           23     A.  Correct.

           24     Q.  Remember saying that?

           25     A.  Correct.


                                
                                                       
                                                                              928



            1     Q.  Now, the New England Journal of Medicine, that's a high

            2     quality journal, isn't it?

            3     A.  New England Journal of Medicine, okay, I -- yeah, I

            4     would say -- I say I was referring to Journal of Fluid

            5     Mechanics, because there are only two, Journal of Fluid

            6     Mechanics - Cambridge and physical -- American Physical

            7     Society in NLN, California.  So these are the two in our

            8     area.  About medicine, I am not an expert, but I know

            9     Lancette and I know Nature, I know these top one, but you

           10     can tell me, if you say this is the good one, then I have to

           11     ask a medical doctor.

           12     Q.  If you're not familiar with it, I don't want to --

           13     A.  Okay.

           14     Q.  -- put you out there.

           15     A.  Okay.

           16     Q.  So if you're not --

           17     A.  Okay.

           18     Q.  And it sounds like you're not?

           19     A.  Correct.

           20     Q.  So you had the discussions about the whole issue of

           21     conflicts and whether there were any conflicts to --

           22     A.  Correct.

           23     Q.  -- Declare?

           24     A.  Yes.

           25     Q.  And, it was, in particular, the, pull up P-628, the


                                
                                                       
                                                                              929



            1     conflicts language at the very end.

            2               Yeah, so this language is what the discussion was

            3     all about was when you published this article, and this was

            4     published, by the way, was it -- did I ask you January 9,

            5     2018?

            6     A.  Something like that, yeah.

            7     Q.  January 9, 2018, where, at the end of it, it is conflict

            8     of interest, and the words, Authors have no conflict of

            9     interest to declare.

           10     A.  Yes.

           11     Q.  And those were words that you supported being put on

           12     there in January of 2018?

           13     A.  Absolutely.  I still do.

           14     Q.  And now, the correction, though, was the correction

           15     issued by the editors of this journal?

           16     A.  The correction was requested by 3M, and we said if they

           17     want it, fine, put it in.  I did not ask it and the editor

           18     did not -- the editor accepted the paper and published it

           19     without mention of anything.  It's only after 3M asked the

           20     editor to contact us, I wrote an e-mail saying, would you

           21     agree with this, fine.  But as far as conflicts of interest,

           22     I have no conflicts of interest with anybody because

           23     otherwise my reputation will suffer.

           24     Q.  I understand.  But --

           25     A.  Okay.


                                
                                                       
                                                                              930



            1     Q.  Just to it has been talked around but the jurors haven't

            2     seen it.

            3     A.  Okay.

            4     Q.  So I just want to see what the corrected language was.

            5     And D-0967.

            6               So here was the correction in the May 10th of 2018

            7     from the editors of this publication, Dr. Elghobashi is a

            8     testifying witness in a court case against 3M, in which the

            9     plaintiffs urge that the Bair Hugger patient warming system

           10     causes periprosthetic joint infections by disrupting the

           11     airflow in operating rooms.  Dr. Apte is a paid consultant

           12     for the plaintiffs.  Correction added on 10th of May, 2018

           13     after first on-line publication.  Conflict of interest

           14     statement has been corrected.

           15               And so that's what was actually then published,

           16     right, sir?

           17     A.  Again, it was requested by 3M and I agreed to publish

           18     it, but I -- in order to mention conflict of interest, that

           19     means I have some doubts about my ethical thing, but I have

           20     none and never did, so this one was input by 3M and I agreed

           21     on it, right.

           22     Q.  Well.

           23     A.  Not the editor.  The editor published the paper without

           24     that statement.

           25     Q.  The editors, if they felt that the correction was


                                
                                                       
                                                                              931



            1     unwarranted, could have chosen not to publish it.  Isn't

            2     that true?

            3     A.  But I agreed on it.  I said, you, editor, you want to

            4     publish this, just put it in.  It's a fact.

            5     Q.  Just stick with my question for just a second.  If the

            6     editors felt that the conflict of interest correction was

            7     unwarranted, they could have chosen not to publish.  Isn't

            8     that true?

            9     A.  I disagree.  Totally disagree.

           10     Q.  And are you telling us, Dr. Elghobashi, that if you were

           11     an expert hired by plaintiffs' lawyer in litigation again

           12     and published research, you would again not disclose that in

           13     the article?

           14     A.  Absolutely.  And because one reason, and I repeat it

           15     again, I told them in 2016 if our computation showed that

           16     squames do not rise to the bed, we will publish it that

           17     because there are people doing Ph.D. we do not interfere

           18     with scientific fact.  Therefore, I never thought about

           19     conflict of interest.

           20     Q.  Yeah.  Let's -- let's move on, sir.

           21     A.  Okay.

           22     Q.  Now, I think you were asked questions about the model

           23     505 Bair Hugger and I think you had told us that you had not

           24     ever seen or touched an actual machine, you had only seen

           25     pictures, right?


                                
                                                       
                                                                              932



            1     A.  For 505?

            2     Q.  Yes, sir.

            3     A.  Right.

            4     Q.  So the model 505 here, such as I can see on the floor, I

            5     know the jurors can, you've never actually tested the model

            6     505 Bair Hugger, true?

            7     A.  It's a incorrect statement.  I don't do experiments in

            8     the lab so when you say tested this particular one doesn't

            9     make any sense.

           10     Q.  Well, let me try to make it -- have it make sense for

           11     you.

           12     A.  Okay.

           13     Q.  You never plugged one in and turned it on, have you,

           14     sir?

           15     A.  I did 750 for an hour.

           16     Q.  I want to be clear.  I'm talking about the product

           17     involved in this case, the model 505.

           18     A.  I never touched 505 model.  I never turned it on because

           19     I have not seen it.

           20     Q.  And so when I talk about testing, I'm talking about

           21     physically plugging in, manipulating, working with this

           22     physical machine, the model 505 that we see an example of

           23     here on the floor, you've never done that, have you, sir?

           24     A.  I did not.

           25     Q.  Have you ever heard of a product called a Tablegard?


                                
                                                       
                                                                              933



            1     A.  Could you repeat the name again?

            2     Q.  Tablegard?

            3     A.  Never heard of it.

            4     Q.  So there wasn't any form of testing you were asked to do

            5     with respect to anything called a Tablegard, true?

            6     A.  Never heard of it, yeah.

            7     Q.  Now, before these lawyers came to you with respect to

            8     issues in this trial, you had never heard of the Bair Hugger

            9     either.  Isn't that true?

           10     A.  You mean in -- in 2016?

           11     Q.  Yes, sir.

           12     A.  I never heard of Bair Hugger, yeah.

           13     Q.  Now, before the lawyers came to you in this case, you

           14     had never done a CFD involving a medical device at all.

           15     Isn't that true?

           16     A.  That is correct.

           17     Q.  And before the lawyers came to you involved in this

           18     case, you told us before you had never done a CFD of an

           19     operating room?  Is that true?

           20     A.  Correct.

           21     Q.  Had you, prior to the lawyers coming to you in this

           22     case, done a CFD generally in any room?

           23     A.  Could you repeat the question, again, please?

           24     Q.  Had you done a CFD in any room before the lawyers who

           25     came to you in April of 2016, the CFD for a room?


                                
                                                       
                                                                              934



            1     A.  Much more than that, yes, for companies who design air

            2     curtains.  When you go to a mall and you have an air curtain

            3     that hot air or cold air to keep the outside temperature

            4     from change, it has rooms like this, and they wanted to know

            5     the affect of the air curtain.  It's like maybe seven, eight

            6     years ago.

            7     Q.  Yeah, fair enough, Dr. Elghobashi, so I'll just stick

            8     with you've not ever been asked to do a CFD in a operating

            9     room, then, before this case?

           10     A.  Yeah, okay.  Operating room, correct, you are correct,

           11     yes.

           12     Q.  Now, when we had looked at the various videos you

           13     prepared from the CFD, isn't it true, sir, that you didn't

           14     actually make the CFDs?  Is that true?

           15     A.  That's a very generic -- what do you mean, did not make?

           16     What do you mean by that?

           17     Q.  Let's be more specific then.

           18     A.  Yes.

           19     Q.  Isn't it true that Dr. Apte --

           20     A.  Yes.

           21     Q.  -- A-P-T-E, Dr. Apte actually made the CFDs that the

           22     jury saw.  Isn't that true?

           23     A.  Okay.  History, the code was built at Stanford with

           24     Dr. Apte and many other, like 15 people, and I asked him to

           25     do that because I don't have Ph.D. student who do that kind


                                
                                                       
                                                                              935



            1     of work to get a Ph.D., okay.

            2     Q.  So to be clear, Dr. -- it was Dr. Apte, then, who was

            3     using his proprietary software to actually create the CFDs

            4     that the jurors saw, right?

            5     A.  Correct.  That's correct.

            6     Q.  That was Dr. Apte and not Dr. Elghobashi, true?

            7     A.  Absolutely correct.

            8     Q.  And the -- and any of the -- some of them were videos

            9     and we saw some PowerPoints, but anything that purported to

           10     reflect the CFD was, in fact, done by Dr. Apte and not

           11     Dr. Elghobashi, true?

           12     A.  Absolutely, correct.

           13     Q.  And now, Dr. Apte is also a consulting expert for these

           14     lawyers sitting here, isn't he, plaintiffs' lawyers?

           15     A.  Correct.

           16     Q.  You actually compensated Dr. Apte out of the funds you

           17     received?

           18     A.  Correct.

           19     Q.  When you received the PowerPoints or the videos from

           20     Dr. Apte, you didn't make any changes to them.  Isn't that

           21     right?

           22     A.  Many -- I did -- these are -- so I am the boss and they

           23     work for me.

           24     Q.  Yes, sir.

           25     A.  And if I see something unacceptable, I -- they change


                                
                                                       
                                                                              936



            1     that.  So many of the ideas that you see here I have to -- I

            2     am the organizer of everything from A to Z.

            3     Q.  Do you -- do you recall being asked the question at your

            4     deposition, do you have any -- did you have any revisions to

            5     the PowerPoint that -- that you then sent back to Dr. Apte?

            6     Answer, no.

            7     A.  The final report, yes, but before you reach that final

            8     stage in December or so, I have to change the angle to show

            9     the different colors or anything, so I had input to produce

           10     the final one.

           11     Q.  But I was just simply asking whether you had any

           12     revisions that you made to the PowerPoints created by

           13     Dr. Apte and the answer to that is no, you didn't have any

           14     changes to that, true?

           15     A.  Okay.  The final PowerPoint that you see, it came after

           16     many exchanges between us and I'm the one who said which of

           17     you, which angle, which height I do that.  I am responsible

           18     for the project.  I'm the PI, principal investigator.

           19     Q.  Also known as the head honcho, right, chief person in

           20     charge, you're the team leader, right?

           21     A.  Yeah.  I've been for many years, yes.

           22     Q.  So let's talk about RANS and LES, large eddy --

           23     A.  Simulation.

           24     Q.  Simulation.  Okay.  Now, we heard quite a bit about

           25     RANS, and I think it's fair to say you kind of ran it down,


                                
                                                       
                                                                              937



            1     right?

            2     A.  Absolutely.

            3     Q.  RANS I think is fair to say you would describe as

            4     suspect?

            5     A.  Correct.

            6     Q.  And not trustworthy, right?

            7     A.  Yes.

            8     Q.  And LES, let me just put this on the page, large eddy

            9     simulation, and that's how it would be spelled, isn't it,

           10     sir?

           11     A.  Correct.  That's correct.

           12     Q.  And so the CFD that was done in this case is a large

           13     eddy simulation?

           14     A.  Correct.

           15     Q.  Involving particles?

           16     A.  Correct.

           17     Q.  Now, do you consider yourself a scientist who

           18     specializes in large eddy simulations, LES?

           19     A.  I can, but my specialty is DNS which is the higher

           20     level, directional DNS, that means the -- the most

           21     accurate -- the gold standard.  LES is necessary in big,

           22     big, oh, geometries like operating rooms so it's by

           23     necessity they have to go to LES, not DNS.

           24     Q.  Have you ever published any paper --

           25     A.  On --


                                
                                                       
                                                                              938



            1     Q.  -- on large eddy simulation?

            2     A.  No.  Only this one.

            3     Q.  And, all right.  So only the one involved in this case?

            4     Now, we've established already what you think of RANS?

            5     A.  Correct.

            6     Q.  Suspect and not trustworthy?

            7     A.  Correct.

            8     Q.  The fact is also, sir, that if we talk about a large

            9     eddy simulation with particles, it's also your view that a

           10     large eddy simulation with particles is also inherently

           11     suspect.  Isn't that true?

           12     A.  I disagree and I would like to explain it.  I can draw

           13     things for you here if you want.

           14     Q.  Let me give you a chance to explain in just a second.

           15     All right.  Can we -- oh.

           16         (Video played.)

           17               "So really any large eddy simulation with

           18     particles I consider suspect at present."

           19         (End of video.)

           20     A.  Okay.  Thank you.  That --

           21     Q.  Let me get to my question, first of all.  Now, this was

           22     from a presentation you gave in 2013 at the University of

           23     California in Santa Barbara.  Is that true?

           24     A.  If you say so.  I gave similar ones all around the

           25     world.  So I can explain to you.


                                
                                                       
                                                                              939



            1     Q.  No, let me finish.  And so -- and these are the words

            2     you use if, when you gave your talk, you said, "So really,

            3     any large eddy simulation with particles I consider suspect

            4     at present."  That's what you said, true?

            5     A.  But you have to understand the picture associated with

            6     that talk.

            7     Q.  Sir, I want to just first be clear --

            8     A.  No, I disagree with you.  You are competing now with an

            9     area in which I spend a hundred years.

           10     Q.  I don't want to argue with you or even take issue with

           11     hundred years.  I just --

           12     A.  Because that picture, that statement is made after I

           13     show that picture.

           14     Q.  Sir.

           15     A.  You have to understand that picture to understand what I

           16     said.  That's a different story.

           17     Q.  Sir, my question is simply, did you say, "really, any

           18     large eddy simulation with particles I consider suspect at

           19     present."  Did you say that?

           20     A.  After the picture.

           21     Q.  Yes or no?

           22     A.  When you make a presentation, you show a diagram, then I

           23     say, okay, you've seen this diagram, therefore, it's

           24     suspect.

           25     Q.  Did you ever publish anything anywhere retracting this


                                
                                                       
                                                                              940



            1     statement, yes or no?

            2     A.  No, I published the same statement, and I can tell you

            3     which paper --

            4     Q.  No, thank you, sir.

            5     A.  I'm just telling you, what you are doing, you are taking

            6     a sentence from a description of a figure.  You have to

            7     understand the figure first and then you will see, oh, that

            8     statement, that makes sense.

            9     Q.  Well, let me just be clear, when you talked about large

           10     eddy simulation with particles before with the jury, it's

           11     fair to say that you didn't make any mention a few years ago

           12     saying that any large eddy simulation with particles I

           13     consider suspect, you didn't -- you didn't bring that up,

           14     sir?

           15     A.  I did, in 1994, I --

           16     Q.  Sir, you answered my question.  And so --

           17     A.  I totally disagree with you because you are highlighting

           18     a statement written for a given figure and that, if you

           19     understand what is written in that figure --

           20               MR. BLACKWELL:  Your Honor, I have to object and

           21     move to strike.

           22               THE COURT:  Let's just have another question.

           23               MR. BLACKWELL:  Okay.

           24               THE WITNESS:  Just for your --

           25               THE COURT:  We do have to wait for a question.


                                
                                                       
                                                                              941



            1     BY MR. BLACKWELL:

            2     Q.  So I want to go back to talk about the assumptions or

            3     boundary conditions that went into the CFD for the model

            4     505.  Dr. Elghobashi, you know that with respect to

            5     operating rooms, there can be -- there are a lot of

            6     differences and variations from one operating room to

            7     another?

            8     A.  Correct.

            9     Q.  And that's why you need the specifics of the operating

           10     room in question if your goal is to do a simulation of what

           11     happened in that room, true?

           12     A.  To a certain extent but not fully.  The main physics in

           13     a operating room can be the same in another room if the

           14     nonessential things change, but the main, the core of the

           15     flow, is unaffected by preferential stuff, okay?  So yes.

           16     Q.  But there are a lot of differences between a lot of

           17     operating rooms?

           18     A.  You can say that about hundreds of operating rooms.  I'm

           19     saying if you want to study the science of a certain

           20     problem, you have to look at the core of the problem and do

           21     it in a way that is not affected by whether the room has a

           22     corner or has a different light or a door or an unessential,

           23     trivial.

           24     Q.  Well, we can agree whether you might consider it trivial

           25     or not?


                                
                                                       
                                                                              942



            1     A.  Okay.

            2     Q.  That the CFD operating room at new model was in the

            3     shape of a rectangle, true?

            4     A.  Correct, yes.

            5     Q.  And is it also true that the shape of the operating room

            6     where Gareis had his surgery at issue was not a rectangle,

            7     it was irregular in shape.  Isn't that true?

            8     A.  If you say so.  It doesn't matter.  Yeah.

            9     Q.  Do you know one way or the other, sir?

           10     A.  I -- I can tell you what Mr. Goss showed me.  He showed

           11     me the one of the air exits with a higher level than the

           12     floor.  And in our simulation the floor exits are in the

           13     floor.  And Mr. Goss showed me an exit, a grille at the same

           14     level as probably the operating room like a four feet or

           15     something.  I don't know.  That's the main thing.  That's in

           16     addition to the grilles were different.

           17     Q.  Dr. Elghobashi, I'm really not trying to trick you.

           18     It's just whether you know if the shape of the operating

           19     room where Mr. Gareis had his surgery was irregular in shape

           20     or not?  Do you know one way or the other?

           21     A.  I don't.

           22     Q.  Okay.  Thank you, sir.  Now, before you were able to

           23     work on the model for the CFD, there were certain boundary

           24     conditions that you went to get established, certain

           25     information you needed?


                                
                                                       
                                                                              943



            1     A.  Correct.

            2     Q.  And they were certain what I'd call key and important

            3     kinds of measurements that you needed?

            4     A.  Yes.  Yes.

            5     Q.  So if we look here, what I have here on the overhead,

            6     some of the key and important measurements, you needed to

            7     know the dimensions and locations of all items and medical

            8     staff in the room.  That's true?

            9     A.  Right.  Yes.

           10     Q.  You needed to know the dimensions and locations of the

           11     inlet and exit air grilles?

           12     A.  Yes.

           13     Q.  And so that's where the fresh air comes in and then

           14     where the air return, where it exits through?

           15     A.  Correct.

           16     Q.  You need to know the air inflow rates at the ceiling

           17     grilles and the outflow rates at the lower grilles?

           18     A.  Correct.

           19     Q.  You wanted to know the electric power output of the

           20     equipment in the room?

           21     A.  Correct.

           22     Q.  You needed to know the air inflow rate to the Bair

           23     Hugger, that is, at what rate is the air coming into the

           24     Bair Hugger?

           25     A.  Correct.


                                
                                                       
                                                                              944



            1     Q.  And the temperature of the air leaving the Bair Hugger

            2     blanket?

            3     A.  Correct.

            4     Q.  Incidentally, when counsel was just here showing you a

            5     Bair Hugger manual and the temperatures are exiting the Bair

            6     Hugger hose, those temperatures would not have been the

            7     temperatures of the air actually leaving the Bair Hugger

            8     blanket, those would be the temperatures at the very end of

            9     the hose, true?

           10     A.  Correct.  Let me just ask you a question.  Talking about

           11     the thousands holes where the air is coming from, the

           12     difference in the temperature of a thousand holes?

           13     Q.  No, sir.

           14     A.  No, no, I know.  You're talking about the exit of the

           15     hose and difference between the air temperature leaving the

           16     blanket?

           17     Q.  Right.  I'm saying that when you were giving

           18     temperatures, the temperature used I think you said

           19     41 celsius?

           20     A.  Yes.

           21     Q.  That temperature would have been the temperature at the

           22     very end of this hose?

           23     A.  I know that.

           24     Q.  I'm asking that, sir.

           25     A.  Oh, I said we took it from the thing.  It's written in


                                
                                                       
                                                                              945



            1     the 3M manual at the exit of the hose.  It said that.

            2     Q.  Yeah, at the exit of the hose.  So not at the exit of

            3     the hose in the blanket, true?

            4     A.  That's why I asked you.  I thought you were talking

            5     about the little hole, thousand holes, one millimeter that

            6     you were talking about.

            7     Q.  Yeah, I'm just trying to clarify that the 41 degrees

            8     celsius temperature you used was at the end of this hose,

            9     not at the holes?

           10     A.  Correct.

           11     Q.  In the blanket, true?

           12     A.  Correct.

           13     Q.  And it would not have been the temperature either where

           14     you say the warm air exited the drape, that might have been

           15     a different temperature too, true?

           16     A.  I calculated -- I calculated the exit temperature

           17     leaving the -- I did calculate that.  So I took this one and

           18     did four pages of calculation, I sent it to your company, it

           19     shows how I got the temperature at the edge of the drape.

           20     So I used this one, a hose exit, and I calculated the rest.

           21     Q.  Yeah, my question really is of this temperature at the

           22     end of the hose is 41 degrees celsius?

           23     A.  Yes, I know that.

           24     Q.  We have a different temperature where the air actually

           25     comes out of the blanket, that's correct, right?


                                
                                                       
                                                                              946



            1     A.  Okay.  The temperature of the -- for a steady state, the

            2     temperature leaving the exit of the hose is the same as

            3     leaving the holes after being around for a long time, not at

            4     the beginning.  The beginning would be a difference between

            5     this one and the exit of the hose and the exit of the air,

            6     but if you ran it for how far, the temperature, at least

            7     the -- the hole is very close to the end of that would be

            8     the same, no difference.

            9     Q.  And you were then looking to take the temperature, where

           10     do you believe the air exited at the bottom of the drape

           11     that you talked about?

           12     A.  That's computed, not assumed.

           13     Q.  All right.

           14     A.  It's computed.

           15     Q.  And so that would have been a different temperature from

           16     the temperature at the end of the hose, right?

           17     A.  Yes.  Yes.  And the report showed that.

           18     Q.  Let's go back to our list.  In any event, you wanted to

           19     know the air inflow rate to the Bair Hugger?

           20     A.  Yes.

           21     Q.  And the temperature of the air leaving the blanket?

           22     A.  Correct.

           23     Q.  And you wanted a drawing of the blanket and the

           24     locations of the drape edges near the floor, true?

           25     A.  Can I ask a question, are you showing me a table that I


                                
                                                       
                                                                              947



            1     created?  I don't know where the table, is this my table?

            2     Q.  I don't know that it's your table, but I think these are

            3     things that you thought were key and important measurements,

            4     aren't they?

            5     A.  Right.  That means I probably have asked somebody to

            6     provide me at the beginning of the project I think.

            7     Q.  But you did want a drawing of the blanket and the

            8     locations of the drape edges near the floor.  You wanted

            9     this last one too?

           10     A.  Absolutely, yeah, yeah, yes.

           11     Q.  And so my next question, which you may have anticipated,

           12     is who would have supplied these measurements that you

           13     wanted?

           14     A.  So eventually we had to go to Santa Monica to do that.

           15     That we -- the reason for going to Santa Monica Hospital is

           16     to provide this information.  That what the main reason we

           17     went to an operating room, yes.

           18     Q.  Isn't it true that every single one of these key and

           19     important measurements were provided by the plaintiffs'

           20     lawyers?  Every one of them?  Isn't that true, sir?

           21     A.  Okay, they gave me the drawing of the blanket from 3M,

           22     and the temperature I got it from the hose from your manual,

           23     and the airflow rate for the Bair Hugger, from the manual.

           24     They may have given me the manual to look at this.  If you

           25     want to say they gave it to me, that's fine.


                                
                                                       
                                                                              948



            1     Q.  No, no, I'm not trying to make up anything.

            2     A.  All right.

            3     Q.  Sir, if pull up defense 966.  Oh, I'm sorry.  And here,

            4     sir, is where you say, the following data will be provided

            5     by Gabriel.

            6     A.  Right.

            7     Q.  And Gabriel is Gabriel Assaad, isn't it?

            8     A.  He's a gentleman sitting there, yes.

            9     Q.  He's a gentleman too.

           10     A.  Yes, yes.

           11     Q.  Gabriel Assaad, and that's one of the plaintiff's

           12     lawyers?

           13     A.  Right.  And I know you're using terminology that I'm not

           14     very familiar with, but yes, he is the gentleman sitting

           15     there, yes.

           16     Q.  Okay.  So if you look here what's on the screen, these

           17     six items that I just had up on the chart also --

           18     A.  Yes.

           19     Q.  -- are the ones you expected --

           20     A.  Yes.

           21     Q.  -- to be provided to you by the plaintiffs' lawyers?

           22     A.  You can see how careful I am, I needed all this at the

           23     beginning of the project.  I wanted this information.  And

           24     after that we had to go to Santa Monica to provide some of

           25     the answers to these questions.


                                
                                                       
                                                                              949



            1     Q.  Dr. Elghobashi, once the lawyers who are suing 3M gave

            2     you this information, isn't it true that you didn't do

            3     anything yourself to independently verify that what you were

            4     getting was accurate?  Is that true?

            5     A.  Yes, as I said repeatedly, I went by myself to

            6     Santa Monica Hospital, spent a day there with nurses to

            7     measure everything.  So what you mean I did not prove, I

            8     mean, I am the one who asked to go to hospital.  They took

            9     them a long time to find a free hospital to interrupt.  I am

           10     the one who requested that.

           11     Q.  Well, let's take, for example, look at No. 2 on this

           12     list, the dimensions and locations of the inlet and exit air

           13     groups?

           14     A.  Yes.

           15     Q.  So you had the exit air grilles down at the floor, true?

           16     A.  Right.

           17     Q.  And you were expecting to get information about the exit

           18     air grilles?

           19     A.  Right.

           20     Q.  From these lawyers, right?

           21     A.  Right, yes.

           22     Q.  Did you do anything to verify that the exit air grilles

           23     were, in fact, at the bottom of the floor as apparently had

           24     been represented to you?

           25     A.  Sir --


                                
                                                       
                                                                              950



            1     Q.  Just yes or no, sir.

            2     A.  I disagree.  Your question is not like that.  You're

            3     saying that the dimension of the grille, the four grilles in

            4     the floor taken from 3M geometry, the ten grilles in the

            5     ceiling, these were taken from either from 3M geometry or

            6     Rochester, when you go to a operating room, we visit all of

            7     them, they have different grilles like the one you

            8     mentioned, Providence, so you want me to simulate all

            9     operating rooms in the world?

           10     Q.  No, sir, I just want to know when you received

           11     information from the lawyers when you did any homework or

           12     research yourself to --

           13     A.  A lot.

           14     Q.  -- independently verify?

           15     A.  I did a lot.

           16     Q.  What did you do, for example, to --

           17     A.  Looking at geometries and ventilation system of -- by

           18     HVAC people.  There were journals.  I spent many, many hours

           19     trying to get that, finally decided that all operating rooms

           20     have different inlet, outlet, like the one in Providence, so

           21     I took the best case scenario for 3M.  All the outlets on

           22     the floor, that's the best case.  If you lose outlet, you

           23     will have more squames out, trust me.

           24     Q.  You were asking, sir, for the locations of inlet and

           25     exit air grilles --


                                
                                                       
                                                                              951



            1     A.  Yes.

            2     Q.  -- as pertained to Mr. Gareis in the hospital in this

            3     case?  What did you do to verify that the information that

            4     you got was accurate?

            5     A.  Mr. Goss showed me the grille location in Providence

            6     operating room, and I told him, and I repeat again, the

            7     location of the grille on the wall at the higher elevations

            8     of the floor increases, enhances the dispersion of squame

            9     toward the table because that allowed the plume of the 505

           10     to rise higher.  If the grille were down, air would --

           11     incoming air would push the heated air down.  If you -- if

           12     you put all the outlet grilles higher, you would have a much

           13     worse operating room.

           14     Q.  So I think I've gotten about the best answer I'm going

           15     to get, so I'm going to move on and ask you another

           16     question.

           17     A.  Okay.  All right.  Good.

           18     Q.  So you made the statement awhile ago when the other

           19     lawyer was standing here that all the other machines in the

           20     operating room had less watts than the Bair Hugger machine.

           21     Who told you that?

           22     A.  I looked in it the web about the different machines in a

           23     operating room, including an anesthesia machine, the

           24     cauterizing machine, the all of that, computer, for example,

           25     the fan of any computer produce like ten watt or something,


                                
                                                       
                                                                              952



            1     very small, computers in operating room has nothing, all

            2     other devices that use intermittently for few seconds or

            3     minute will have no impact, in addition, any electric device

            4     that generates heat with a fan will create its own plume.

            5     If you have many plumes in the room, it will be the worst

            6     case scenario for 3M, so I did not.  I wanted to have a pure

            7     operating room that you not raise any issue about it, trust

            8     me.

            9     Q.  Do you recall what my question was, Dr. Elghobashi?

           10     A.  I don't recall the question.

           11     Q.  It's true, isn't it, that you're not able to tell me or

           12     the jury or anyone what the make or model or any of the

           13     details or specifics were for any piece of equipment that

           14     was, in fact, in the operating room for Mr. Gareis on the

           15     day of his surgery on November 9th, 2010, that's true, isn't

           16     it?

           17     A.  I totally agree with you.

           18               MR. BLACKWELL:  I'm going to switch gears, Your

           19     Honor.

           20               THE COURT:  Actually, we'll take lunch break and

           21     resume at 2 o'clock.

            3               THE COURT:  Please be seated.  And Dr. Elghobashi,

            4     you're still under oath from this morning.  And Mr.

            5     Blackwell is going to resume his questioning, whenever he's

            6     ready.  Are you ready?

            7               THE WITNESS:  Yes.

            8               THE COURT:  All right.

            9     BY MR. BLACKWELL:

           10     Q.  Good afternoon again, Dr. Elghobashi.

           11     A.  Good afternoon.

           12     Q.  I hope you had a nice lunch.

           13     A.  Thank you.

           14     Q.  I want to go back to the testing you did of the Santa

           15     Monica that you talked to us a little bit about.

           16     A.  Yes.

           17     Q.  And I believe it's true that you had never before seen a

           18     Bair Hugger set up in an operating room at the time of the

           19     experimentation you did out in Santa Monica; is that right?

           20     A.  Correct.

           21     Q.  So is it true then that the persons who actually set up

           22     that operating room and arranged the whole thing were,

           23     again, these lawyers; is that right?

           24     A.  Could you repeat the question again, please?

           25     Q.  The persons who set up the visit to the operating room


 

                                                                              954



            1     in Santa Monica were the attorneys who hired you, true?

            2     A.  I requested to visit any operating room in Southern

            3     California University, anywhere, and they took them like two

            4     months to find the appropriate, so it was done on my

            5     request.

            6     Q.  It was done on your request, but I'm just trying to be

            7     clear, it was set up by the attorneys; is that right?

            8     A.  Correct.

            9     Q.  Now, the hospital you found then or they found in Santa

           10     Monica was a hospital where the Bair Hugger was in fact

           11     being used in orthopedic surgeries, true?

           12     A.  I cannot say yes or no, I don't know.  We just wanted

           13     her to set up the machine to look at it.  I don't know if

           14     they used it yesterday, tomorrow, I have no idea.

           15     Q.  Well, you wanted the RN to set up the machine in the way

           16     she typically sets it up, true?

           17     A.  Correct.

           18     Q.  And if she wasn't using the Bair Hugger at the hospital,

           19     she couldn't set it up the way she typically does, true?

           20     A.  True.

           21     Q.  So that tells us the Bair Hugger was being used in

           22     orthopedic procedures at that hospital?

           23     A.  I cannot say.  I'm very precise.  I don't know that.

           24     Q.  Okay.  So but suffice it to say when you were doing this

           25     experimentation in this operating room in Santa Monica that


 

                                                                              955



            1     there wasn't an actual surgery taking place?

            2     A.  Correct.

            3     Q.  There was to surgeon there, true?

            4     A.  Correct.

            5     Q.  Now, in terms of the way the room was set up and the

            6     involvement of the lawyers, you didn't do anything to verify

            7     that the setup was correct and typical, true?

            8     A.  Since I'm not a medical doctor, I asked the nurse if is

            9     this the way you do it for surgery and she said yes.

           10     Q.  But it's nothing you did because you wouldn't have a

           11     basis to know, right?

           12     A.  I'm not a medical doctor, yes.

           13     Q.  So when you were doing this testing in Santa Monica in

           14     the operating room, you turned on the Bair Hugger.  It was

           15     turned on, true?

           16     A.  We set first, put the lawyer on the table, the drape,

           17     then we turn it on.  It was not on before.

           18     Q.  So in the course after things were set up, then you turn

           19     on the Bair Hugger?

           20     A.  Correct.

           21     Q.  The Bair Hugger gets up to temperature presumably?

           22     A.  Correct.

           23     Q.  Now, once the Bair Hugger was up to temperature, is it

           24     true that nobody took any measurement of the air temperature

           25     coming out of the Bair Hugger.  Is that true?


 

                                                                              956



            1     A.  That is correct.

            2     Q.  Nobody took any measurements of the velocity of the air

            3     coming out of the Bair Hugger.  Is that true?

            4     A.  That's correct.  As I mentioned earlier, I would not ask

            5     them to do that because, again, it's my philosophy.  You

            6     have to use PIV laser and no interference that's why I would

            7     never ask them to do put hand in with a thermometer.  I

            8     would not do that.

            9     Q.  Well, but in fairness, what you did with respect to the

           10     drapes in the experiment was just run your hand underneath

           11     the drapes, true?

           12     A.  Not to measure temperature, to see if the air coming

           13     near the neck or near the arms, that's all, but not very

           14     fine temperature, velocity, or anything.

           15     Q.  But, Dr. Elghobashi, wasn't it possible and fairly

           16     simple to use a temperature probe to take in some

           17     readings --

           18     A.  No, sir.

           19     Q.  -- to --

           20     A.  No, sir.  No, you cannot put something --

           21     Q.  Dr. Elghobashi you have to let me finish my question, so

           22     let me finish it.  I think I hear your opposition to it, but

           23     I still have to ask it.

           24     A.  Okay.

           25     Q.  Wouldn't it have been -- isn't it true that someone


 

                                                                              957



            1     could have taken a temperature probe and taking some

            2     readings around the Bair Hugger blanket, wasn't that

            3     possible to do?

            4     A.  I would not recommend anybody to do it, therefore, it

            5     would be wrong.  It would be incorrect measure.  Why would I

            6     measure something that's incorrect?

            7     Q.  Sir, I'm just asking you was it possible to take a

            8     temperature probe and measure the air temperature probe

            9     around the Bair --

           10     A.  It is possible --

           11     Q.  Dr. Elghobashi, excuse me.

           12               THE COURT REPORTER:  One at a time.

           13     BY MR. BLACKWELL:

           14     Q.  So either that was possible to do or it was not possible

           15     to do?

           16     A.  It is always possible to carry a probe around the room

           17     and do something with it.

           18     Q.  And the something that could have been done was measured

           19     the temperature around the Bair Hugger blanket.  Is that

           20     fair?

           21     A.  I disagree.  I cannot keep disagreeing with you, but it

           22     is meaningless to put anything and say this is the

           23     temperature.  There is something called Heisenberg

           24     principle, to your finger in, you would ruin what you're

           25     measuring.  That's why it has to be non-invasive.


 

                                                                              958



            1     Q.  So let's bring this back to the operating room number 4

            2     at Providence Hospital Northeast in Columbia, South

            3     Carolina, where the surgery took place on November 9, 2010.

            4     Now, were you aware that there was an opportunity for

            5     experts like yourself to come out to the actual operating

            6     roo Mr. Gareis had been i to take your own measurements.

            7     Did you know that?

            8     A.  I will repeat what you told me, just to make sure I

            9     understood.  You said I could have gone to whatever this

           10     other hospital is and take measurements and I said earlier I

           11     don't trust in taking measurements the way you propose so

           12     why would I go to place to do something that is illogical to

           13     me?  It doesn't make sense.

           14     Q.  Let me ask my question again because I don't want to

           15     argue with you.

           16     A.  Okay.

           17     Q.  I just want to know whether you were aware that there

           18     was an opportunity for an expert like yourself to come out

           19     to the hospital where the surgery took place and either take

           20     measurements or have measurements taken.  Did you know that?

           21     A.  I have not known that.

           22     Q.  So to the extent there was a meeting set up for that

           23     purpose, is it fair to say that you weren't invited to the

           24     meeting as far as you know?

           25     A.  I was not invited to a meeting in the Carolinas.


 

                                                                              959



            1     Q.  Now, when you were finally able to see the actual

            2     photographs of operating room number 4, and you said

            3     Mr. Goss showed them to you?

            4     A.  Yes.

            5     Q.  There is Mr. Goss?

            6     A.  I met him in the morning.

            7     Q.  And he showed them to you, and at the time he showed you

            8     those photographs, didn't you ask the question how come

            9     these photographs weren't shown to me before today.  Isn't

           10     that what you asked?

           11     A.  My memory is not very good, but if it was written that I

           12     said that, then I trust you.  I cannot remember.  I mean I

           13     have so many things.

           14     Q.  I'm okay, I'll do trust to verify.  So if you could look

           15     in your big binder we have up there.

           16     A.  Oh.

           17     Q.  And look your deposition for February 10th of 2018.

           18     A.  Okay.  I have it.

           19     Q.  And then go to page 226 and lines 22 through 25 on

           20     page 226?

           21     A.  I have -- I have page -- the page has four pages.  The

           22     one page has four squares, right?

           23     Q.  If you look at the square that has the 226 in the

           24     corner.

           25     A.  Okay, I have it.


 

                                                                              960



            1     Q.  Okay.  And lines 22 through 25.

            2     A.  I do.

            3     Q.  And do you see where the question is asked -- where you

            4     ask --

            5     A.  Yes.

            6     Q.  -- how come they didn't show me these pictures before

            7     today?

            8     A.  Right.

            9     Q.  What did your lawyer say?  Would you read that for the

           10     ladies and gentlemen of the jury?

           11     A.  Because they are irrelevant.

           12     Q.  So when you asked how come you didn't see the pictures

           13     before today, it was the same lawyers who are telling you

           14     that the pictures that show the actual operating room are

           15     irrelevant, that's what they said?

           16     A.  That's what's written here, yes.

           17     Q.  And that's what you heard?

           18     A.  I don't remember but it's written, means I heard it,

           19     yes.

           20     Q.  So in any event, had Mr. Goss or 3M not shown you the

           21     photographs of the operating room, for all you know you'd

           22     never have seen them, right?

           23     A.  Correct.

           24     Q.  Now, going to another subject, Dr. Elghobashi.  The jury

           25     has heard some references already that relate to the


 

                                                                              961



            1     movement of personnel and in out of the operating room and

            2     the significance of that.  Do you understand that the

            3     movement of personnel in and out of the operating room is an

            4     important risk factor for surgical infections?  Do you know

            5     one way or the other?

            6     A.  I'm not a medical doctor.

            7     Q.  Now, I think you told us before that none of the

            8     personnel that you had depicted in your CFD move?

            9     A.  Correct.

           10     Q.  If the -- at least assume for purposes of my question

           11     that the international consensus of orthopedic surgeons has

           12     a statement, persons in the operating room are a major

           13     source of bacterial load and shed bacterial particulates.

           14     These particulates circulate through the operating room via

           15     air currents.  Movements of personnel and objects, including

           16     operating room equipment and opening and closing doors, can

           17     generate significantly marked air currents and increase the

           18     probability of bacteria being deposited in the surgical

           19     site.  So I take it given your answer that you are not a

           20     medical doctor, then you don't have any basis to disagree

           21     with the international consensus of orthopedic surgeon on

           22     the significance of the movement of personnel and object in

           23     the operating room?

           24     A.  I agree on parts of this that does not mention

           25     infection.  If you open the door or let the people move, you


 

                                                                              962



            1     will enhance the spreading of squames.  I'm not talking

            2     about infection.  So that's why I said all our computations

            3     were done as the best case scenario for 3M not our side.

            4     Q.  You keep repeating that.  Are you --

            5     A.  Yes, I do.

            6     Q.  -- suggesting --

            7     A.  I do, I do.

            8     Q.  May I finish, please, sir?  Are you suggesting to the

            9     jury that you are being paid over $250,000 to help 3M, are

           10     you trying to suggest that?

           11     A.  The science, what the science I perform to prove to show

           12     these results, I could have picked moving people easily.  I

           13     could have opened/closed the door and the squames would have

           14     been risen at a much higher rate than what I did, so I did

           15     the one -- you mentioned the money.  Don't mention the

           16     money.  I don't care about the 250, that's just nothing.

           17     Q.  You don't care, it's nothing?

           18     A.  Absolutely nothing for because it's paid to students.

           19     Q.  Dr. Elghobashi, if what the jury wants to get is an

           20     accurate picture of the nature of squames or particles or

           21     bacteria.

           22     A.  Yes.

           23     Q.  Taking into account all of the factors that may have

           24     contributed to it in the operating room, we can agree that

           25     your CFD does not depict that, true?


 

                                                                              963



            1     A.  I repeat again.  If we allowed the people to move and

            2     the doors to open and close, the Bair Hugger effect would

            3     have been enhanced in spreading squames.  So we did it such

            4     that just to isolate the effect of the Bair Hugger, that's

            5     how we do science.

            6     Q.  With all due respect, sir, you're not answering my

            7     question.  If the jury wants to understand all of the

            8     factors in the operating room that might affect the air

            9     currents, the movement of squames or particles or bacteria,

           10     your CFD does not encompass or include all of the factors

           11     that would contribute to air movement occurrence in the

           12     operating room.  Is that true?

           13               MS. ZIMMERMAN:  Objection, Your Honor.  Asked and

           14     answered.

           15               THE COURT:  Overruled.

           16     BY MR. BLACKWELL:

           17     Q.  Is it true, sir?

           18     A.  I answered my answer which is the correct answer for me.

           19     I cannot answer any more.  What do you want me to do?

           20     Q.  I would like you to tell me if it's true or not true,

           21     sir?

           22     A.  Which is what is true and not, could you repeat it

           23     again?

           24     Q.  I will try one more time.

           25     A.  Yes, please.


 

                                                                              964



            1     Q.  If the jury wants to understand all of the factors in

            2     the operating room that would contribute to the movement or

            3     air currents and/or the creation of squames or particles,

            4     Mr. Gareis's operating room, your CFD does not take into

            5     account all of the factors that would have contributed to

            6     the movement of air currents in the operating room.  That's

            7     a true statement, isn't it?

            8     A.  I disagree.  And you want me to explain to you why, I

            9     will do it.  I disagree with that statement, yes, I do.

           10     Q.  Well, let me ask you then this way.  If you say you

           11     disagree and you took into account all of the factors, isn't

           12     it true that in no respect whatsoever did you attribute any

           13     value to the fact that the doors to that operating room were

           14     opened and closed at least six times during the surgery of

           15     Mr. Gareis on November 9, 2010, you didn't factor in even

           16     one of them, did you, sir?

           17     A.  I did not account for any door closing or opening.

           18     Q.  Thank you.  You answered my question.

           19     A.  Okay.

           20     Q.  Isn't it true that to the extent there's other equipment

           21     in the operating room that generates heat or blows air, you

           22     included not a single one of them in your CFD.  Isn't that

           23     also true?

           24     A.  It is true but irrelevant.

           25     Q.  That may be your opinion.  I'm just trying to understand


 

                                                                              965



            1     what you did and what you considered.  Isn't it also true,

            2     even though you said you were putting together the best case

            3     for 3M, that the patient that you had modelled in your CFD

            4     was a patient that had zero bacteria on his or her own body.

            5     Isn't that true?

            6     A.  Do you mean I made sure that our patient in the

            7     simulation is not sick?

            8     Q.  No, that's not what I meant.

            9     A.  If you have bacteria on something means it's not right.

           10     I did not -- I took a clean patient.

           11     Q.  All right.  So a clean patient, you meant a patient that

           12     had no bacteria is what you took, true?

           13     A.  We do not account for bacteria because they are much

           14     smaller than the smallest turbine scale.

           15     Q.  Sir, I'm trying to understand what you assumed.  So when

           16     you say that you took a patient that was cleaned or whatever

           17     word you used, you presume to have a patient in your CFD

           18     that contained no bacteria on his or her skin, that's a true

           19     statement, isn't it?

           20     A.  I disagree.  The simulation does not account for

           21     bacteria at all, whether patient or floor or medical stuff,

           22     so there is no place to put bacteria in because bacteria is

           23     much smaller than the particle, the squames.

           24     Q.  All right.  So fairness to your point, if there is no

           25     bacteria taken into account, that means there would have


 

                                                                              966



            1     been no bacteria on the patient, correct?  Just yes or no,

            2     sir.

            3     A.  If you want me to say yes, I will say yes, yes.

            4     Q.  No bacteria on any of the physicians or other operating

            5     room personnel, that's true too, isn't it?

            6     A.  We do not account for bacteria because it's impossible

            7     for the method we use.  The smallest particle is ten

            8     microns.  Bacteria is much smaller.

            9     Q.  Let me ask you, one of the papers that you cited in a

           10     report in this case is called the Saarinen, S-A-A-R-I-N-E-N,

           11     from 2015.  Do you remember the Saarinen paper?

           12     A.  Could you tell me which paper, which --

           13     Q.  If you look behind your report that's at the date

           14     November 27, 2017, in your book up there.

           15     A.  Okay.

           16     Q.  You'll see page 6 of your --

           17     A.  Do I have a report here?  I don't know.

           18     Q.  Yes, sir.  It's in the big, the big --

           19     A.  Big folder, this one?

           20     Q.  Yes, it's in the party favor I gave you before we got

           21     started.

           22     A.  Can you give me tell which title, please?

           23     Q.  Yeah, so if you goes to Elghobashi report, November 27,

           24     2017.

           25     A.  Yes, I do.  I have it, yeah.


 

                                                                              967



            1     Q.  And then if you go to what's labelled as page 6?

            2     A.  The report has only four pages.

            3     Q.  Yeah, I see that.  So you had two reports,

            4     Dr. Elghobashi, so this would be in the March 29, 2017,

            5     which is the very next tab.

            6     A.  Okay, which page?

            7     Q.  Page 6.

            8     A.  I have page 6, yeah, I do.

            9     Q.  And you will see the line that reads in the first full

           10     paragraph at line 23, "LES applied to operating rooms with

           11     medical staff and other instruments is still challenging,

           12     owing to the size of the room and the complexities of the

           13     geometries involved"?

           14     A.  Yes.

           15     Q.  "At the time of writing this report, only one LES study

           16     has been performed for an operating room" --

           17     A.  Yes.

           18     Q.  -- "by Saarinen in 2015"?

           19     A.  Correct.

           20     Q.  So are you familiar then with the Saarinen study, sir,

           21     that you cited in your report?

           22     A.  Yes, I read it maybe whenever it was written, back two

           23     years ago, yes.

           24     Q.  And I think you said two years ago that this Saarinen

           25     study shows that LES can predict such flows, can predict the


 

                                                                              968



            1     airflows through validation and with experimental

            2     operations?

            3     A.  Can you allow me to read this paragraph to remind

            4     myself, please?

            5     Q.  Yes, sir.  No, please do.

            6     A.  Okay, I got it.  I read it.

            7     Q.  So the Saarinen paper reference there, it included not

            8     just the text but also a number of supporting videos.  Do

            9     you remember seeing any Saarinen videos?

           10     A.  I may have.  I've seen many, but, I -- yeah, if you

           11     think -- I read the paper and if it has a video, I would

           12     have seen it, yes.

           13     Q.  All right.  Well, let's see, if you've seen the video,

           14     then I wanted to ask you about the video.  And if not I will

           15     stop and we'll --

           16     A.  All right, sure, sure.

           17     Q.  So let's look at D0946.

           18               (Video played.)

           19     Q.  So the Saarinen video shows a CFD simulation of a door

           20     opening into a positive pressure room and then a nurse

           21     walking through it.  Do you remember seeing this before?

           22     A.  I don't but if -- it's fine.  I mean, whatever it's a

           23     video and I --

           24     Q.  No, sir.  I won't go further with it if you don't have a

           25     recollection of having seen it.  So I will move on.


 

                                                                              969



            1     A.  It just makes sense, if it moves, it gets very

            2     plausible, but I have no memory.

            3     Q.  No, I won't even inquire about something that you don't

            4     have a recollection of.

            5     A.  Okay.

            6     Q.  So let's move on to talk about the Nationals Institute

            7     of Health and Memarzadeh?

            8     A.  Yes, sir.

            9     Q.  And Dr. Memarzadeh used the RANS approach?

           10     A.  Correct.

           11     Q.  And I think you were of the view that RANS is synonymous

           12     with rubbish.

           13     A.  Let's say -- I said more than that.  I said you can -

           14     you want to use RANS in a pipe floater, that's fine, we

           15     teach a student, younger kids, to do that so they can get

           16     the job, but I would not tell a student to use it to do an

           17     operating room.

           18     Q.  Now, you do know who Dr. Memarzadeh is?

           19     A.  I remember the first one he used RANS, yeah, I do.

           20     Q.  Now, you had mentioned when other counsel was asking you

           21     questions that you have done some work for the National

           22     Institutes of Health in the past, right?

           23     A.  Correct.

           24     Q.  Dr. Memarzadeh was in fact and actually an employee of

           25     the National Institute of Health; is that right?


 

                                                                              970



            1     A.  I think I remember, but I don't know.  I mean, it's a

            2     different division.

            3     Q.  But you do know him as a scientist?

            4     A.  I never met him.  I don't know him.  I just read his

            5     paper.  That's all.  I have no idea who he is.

            6     Q.  And the paper you read was of a CFD?

            7     A.  Yeah.

            8     Q.  That he had done as an employee of the National

            9     Institute of Health involving the Bair Hugger, right?

           10     A.  Yeah.

           11     Q.  And now he published his results too from his study and

           12     came to a conclusion that's different from yours, didn't he?

           13     A.  It doesn't matter.  I don't look at RANS papers.

           14     Q.  Sir, it --

           15     A.  It doesn't matter.

           16     Q.  It matters to my question so --

           17     A.  I don't remember what he said.  When I see a paper with

           18     RANS, I just put it away.  I don't read it.

           19     Q.  So you told us previously that you had read his paper,

           20     had you not?  Did you not read his paper?

           21     A.  Oh, okay.  When I read the paper, if it's high quality,

           22     I read it from front to end.  If I open a paper and I see

           23     unacceptable method, I just look at the summary and stop.

           24     Q.  All right.  So with respect to Dr. Memarzadeh and the

           25     criticisms you gave today on his methodology, isn't it true


 

                                                                              971



            1     that you never wrote anything to either the National

            2     Institutes of Health or anyone else critical of

            3     Dr. Memarzadeh's methodology.  Is that true?

            4     A.  Why would I write -- there are tens of thousands of

            5     paper published every year using RANS.

            6     Q.  Dr. Elghobashi, I'm just trying to understand whether

            7     you wrote your criticism to the National Institutes of

            8     Health, and sir, either you did or you did not?

            9     A.  If the paper came to me to review I would reject it, but

           10     since I'm not a reviewer and I'm not his boss, if I am his

           11     boss, I'll tell him don't it, but he did it so I have

           12     nothing to say.

           13     Q.  So Dr. Memarzadeh's paper was written in 2010, right?

           14     A.  Could be.  I don't remember.

           15     Q.  Well, I'll represent to you that it was 2010 and assume

           16     that it was?

           17     A.  I accept your representation, yes.

           18     Q.  So that means he wrote his paper at least six years

           19     before you had ever even heard of the Bair Hugger, true?

           20     A.  I read the paper by Mr. Memarzadeh when the counsel

           21     asked me whether I would be interested in doing that work.

           22     So I looked at the literature and I saw that.  That would be

           23     2016.  Why do you say 2010?

           24     Q.  It was 2010 that Dr. Memarzadeh published his paper.

           25     A.  Fine.  If he did, that's fine.  I have no problem.


 

                                                                              972



            1     Q.  And the fact is that you had no cause to make any

            2     criticism of Dr. Memarzadeh's work until after the time you

            3     had been retained to be an expert witness in this case.

            4     That's true, isn't it?

            5     A.  Sir, I disagree with everything you said.

            6     Q.  That's generally true today.  So but my question is --

            7     A.  Can I explain, give you some history to help you?

            8     Imperial College of London created RANS model.  My Ph.D. was

            9     in RANS, so I -- because 1974, '71, there were no computers

           10     to do DNS or LES.  We have University of London computer was

           11     smaller than your laptop.  So I have a Ph.D., '74, in one of

           12     the best schools in the world.  We use RANS because RANS was

           13     created at Imperial College.  Everybody know that.  What I'm

           14     saying to you, do not use RANS in a complex geometry because

           15     it will fail.  No person in the royal society of London, no

           16     person in the national academy of America will disagree with

           17     me.  They know what I say.  So I know RANS because I did my

           18     Ph.D. using it, okay?

           19     Q.  Do you remember my question, sir?

           20     A.  No.

           21     Q.  My question was whether you had had any cause to

           22     criticize Dr. Memarzadeh or his methodologies until after

           23     the time you had been retained as an expert by these

           24     lawyers.  You had not ever criticized Dr. Memarzadeh before

           25     you had become an expert in this case.  That's a true


 

                                                                              973



            1     statement, isn't it?

            2     A.  If you insist, you can make it true, but I had no reason

            3     to read something I don't know about.

            4     Q.  Let me --

            5     A.  I have no reason to -- I have no reason to write to a

            6     person that I never read or know anything about him.  I

            7     don't write to Chinese, to Japanese that use RANS, I don't

            8     do that.

            9     Q.  All right.  So let me ask you about the conclusion he

           10     reached as you read the paper, where he said forced air

           11     warmers seem to cause minimum disruption to laminar airflow

           12     systems that help protect the surgical site from

           13     contaminated particles sourced from surgical staff.  This

           14     investigation validates Moretti's conclusion that forced air

           15     warming technology does not increase the risk of surgical

           16     wound infection.  That's what Dr. Moretti said, true?

           17     A.  If you read it, I agree with you, that's what you read,

           18     but it's rubbish because there is no laminar flow in an

           19     operating room.

           20     Q.  Good point.  So to the extent anyone walks to the back

           21     doors of this court, comes in here and takes the stand and

           22     says there is such a thing as laminar flow that creates a

           23     force field in the operating room, that is pure rubbish,

           24     isn't it?

           25     A.  What's the last word?


 

                                                                              974



            1     Q.  Rubbish.

            2     A.  Absolutely.  RANS number is ten thousand, there's no

            3     laminar flow.

            4     Q.  Right.  So anybody claming there's laminar flow and it

            5     creates force field?

            6     A.  Right.

            7     Q.  It's not just rubbish, it's absolute rubbish?

            8     A.  Absolute rubbish, and I give an excuse because that

            9     person does not know turbulence.

           10     Q.  They don't know turbulence and they don't know what

           11     they're talking about?

           12     A.  No, because they don't know turbulence, they make silly

           13     statement.

           14     Q.  Okay.  We'll take silly, silly statement.

           15     A.  Yeah.

           16     Q.  So I know the answer to this question, I'll ask it any

           17     way.  You never had any desire to reach out and have a

           18     conversation with Dr. Memarzadeh about how his conclusions

           19     may differ from yours.  Is that true?

           20     A.  Absolutely no interest.  Absolutely no interest.

           21     Q.  Thank you, Dr. Elghobashi.

           22     A.  You're welcome.

           23               THE COURT:  All right.  Ms. Zimmerman, anything

           24     else?

           25


 

                                                                             975



            1                        REDIRECT EXAMINATION

            2     BY MS. ZIMMERMAN:

            3     Q.  Good afternoon, again, Dr. Elghobashi.

            4     A.  Good afternoon.

            5     Q.  Mr. Blackwell asked you some questions about whether or

            6     not you did a CFD in the operating room where Mr. Gareis had

            7     his surgery.  Do you remember that?

            8     A.  Correct.

            9     Q.  And do you have an opinion about whether the CFD that

           10     you did is relevant to the operating room that Mr. Gareis's

           11     surgery took place in?

           12     A.  I do absolutely, yes.

           13     Q.  How is it relevant?

           14     A.  We put in the operating room all the ingredients that

           15     would distinguish between the blower on or the blower off.

           16     We had the patient, the operating table, the Bair Hugger

           17     blanket, the drape, certain lights, people.

           18     Q.  Let me stop you for a second.  What's this a photograph

           19     of?

           20     A.  It's an operating room with a patient on an operating

           21     table showing the knee of the patient and --

           22     Q.  Is that the draping you used in your model?

           23     A.  Correct.

           24     Q.  And so you were explaining to the ladies and gentlemen

           25     of the jury why you believe your CFD is relevant to


 

                                                                             976



            1     Mr. Gareis's operating room?

            2     A.  Could you repeat the question again, please?

            3     Q.  Sure.  Do you believe that the CFD, the LES that you did

            4     on the Model 505, is also relevant to the operating room?

            5     A.  Absolutely, no question.

            6     Q.  And how?

            7     A.  It has all the information needed to study the effect of

            8     a device, air warming device, in a room in the neighborhood

            9     of an operating table.  And again, the room has 25 air

           10     changes per hour, four exit ducts, like, again, I know the

           11     3M lawyer did not like that, but that's what the best

           12     scenario for 3M, the best.  I could have added more things

           13     that would have enhanced the spreading of squames,

           14     absolutely.  Any additional heating from a fan, from a

           15     machine will create its own plume that will resist the

           16     cooler air coming from the ceiling so it will be much worse.

           17     Q.  Are there any other heat sources in the operating room

           18     that have a greater heat source than the Bair Hugger?

           19     A.  I don't think so.  I mean, the Bair Hugger had the more

           20     wattage than any other device running continuously.  There

           21     are other devices intermittently used.

           22     Q.  And Mr. Blackwell asked you some questions about the

           23     assumptions that you made.

           24     A.  Right.

           25     Q.  And that those were from the lawyers like me.  Is that


 

                                                                             977



            1     right?  Do you remember that?

            2     A.  Could you repeat?  I don't remember.

            3     Q.  Mr. Blackwell was asking you questions about the

            4     boundary conditions that you did?

            5     A.  Oh, yes, yes, right.

            6     Q.  And Mr. Blackwell said that you got all of that

            7     information from the lawyers on the plaintiffs' side?

            8     A.  Oh, right, right.  He mentioned that.

            9     Q.  I'm going to show you, this is Plaintiffs' Exhibit 1337,

           10     page 12, which is previously admitted.  Does this show that

           11     the temperature at the end of the hose?

           12     A.  Right.

           13     Q.  Is 43 degrees?

           14     A.  Yes.

           15     Q.  And does this document tell you what temperature comes

           16     out of the holes?

           17     A.  No, it didn't.  It just showed what the exit of the

           18     hose, at the end of the hose, that's what I told him.

           19     Q.  Does it say the air temperature is reaching the patient

           20     or approximately 2 degrees celsius lower?

           21     A.  Right.  Yeah, and we did 41.

           22     Q.  And so that's from 3M's document?

           23     A.  Yeah, I tried to explain to him, yeah.

           24     Q.  And it also shows the BTUs, correct?  What am I doing, I

           25     can touch my paper.  Does it show the heat generated by the


 

                                                                             978



            1     Bair Hugger?

            2               MR. BLACKWELL:  Objection, Your Honor.  Leading.

            3               THE COURT:  Sustained.

            4               MS. ZIMMERMAN:  Withdrawn.

            5     BY MS. ZIMMERMAN:

            6     Q.  You just had some questions posed to you on laminar

            7     airflow.

            8     A.  Yes.

            9     Q.  What is the difference between unidirectional and

           10     laminar airflow?

           11     A.  No connection whatsoever.  Laminar, as I showed in the

           12     PowerPoint, means RANS number should be less than 2,000.

           13     Unidirectional flow means a flow in a garden hose going from

           14     left to right, that would be unidirectional.  Laminar can be

           15     just anything that has a low RANS number.  And in the

           16     operating room, some people call it uni direction just

           17     absolute nonsense.  You've seen the videos, it's all eddies

           18     everywhere.  There is nothing called unidirectional when you

           19     have a grille pushing air or anything into a room, nothing.

           20     The recirculation, I mean, we teach that for undergraduates.

           21     Q.  Did the LES that you did with the Bair Hugger off tell

           22     you anything about the effect of a unidirectional airflow?

           23     A.  There is nothing called uni direction.  We put the

           24     airflow from ten grilles at so many meters per second or a

           25     fraction of that going down, and once they leave, they take


 

                                                                             979



            1     their own behavior from equation, the turbulence will have

            2     --

            3               Let's say this.  If you have a garden hose

            4     one-inch in diameter connected to another garden hose

            5     three-inch diameter, we call this southern expansion, mean

            6     you can that in air conditioning devices or rockets or

            7     anything, it's a small pipe connected to a bigger pipe.

            8     Once the flow leave the little pipe, immediately at the edge

            9     of the junction you have recirculation.

           10               So if you look at the ceiling, this is big room

           11     it's a big pipe and those little guys are pushing air

           12     immediately bubbles, we call it bubbles, recirculation is

           13     on, yeah, yeah, that's nothing, trust me, no unidirectional

           14     flow, none.

           15     Q.  All right.  Mr. Blackwell asked you some questions about

           16     the timing of your report, do you recall that, and versus

           17     when this lawsuit was commenced?

           18     A.  I think he wrote some dates in by pencil April

           19     something, yeah, okay.

           20     Q.  And you don't know as you sit here today what other

           21     evidence the plaintiffs had, the plaintiffs' lawyers had?

           22     A.  No clue, I have no clue about these things.

           23     Q.  You don't know what kind of 3M documents we had when we

           24     filed those cases?

           25     A.  Zero.  I don't have no brain for that.


 

                                                                             980



            1     Q.  Have you seen the pictures from Mr. Gareis's hospital in

            2     Providence?

            3     A.  Mr. Goss showed me?

            4     Q.  Yes.

            5     A.  Yes, I seen.

            6     Q.  Did the difference in the operating room that you've

            7     seen in the photos, do they change your view about whether

            8     or not the Bair Hugger Model 505 can take squames from near

            9     the floor and deposit them on the surgical site?

           10     A.  None whatsoever.  None.  Actually, if I had time or

           11     energy to do the other room in detail which it will much

           12     worse.  All the squames would be rising at a much faster

           13     rate.  For two reason.  Number one, the airflow rate in the

           14     Providence Hospital at the grille, the RANS number is 6,000.

           15     The one we did in our thing, in our big room for 25 changes

           16     per hour produces RANS number between nine and ten thousand.

           17     That means the air coming from the ceiling, what we did for

           18     505 is a stronger flow that scavenges everything in front of

           19     it.  If I had done the Providence room, the lower RANS

           20     number, you would have seen the plums coming up very

           21     quickly.

           22     Q.  All right.  It only gets worse?

           23     A.  I keep saying to him, he did not trust me, but I told

           24     him it's the best scenario for 3M, repeat it.

           25     Q.  All right.  Now, Mr. Blackwell asked you some questions


 

                                                                             981



            1     about a presentation that you did in Santa Barbara.

            2     A.  Yes.

            3     Q.  Do you recall that?

            4     A.  Yes, and I tried to explain to him that the picture,

            5     that what he presented was incorrect.

            6     Q.  And you wanted to explain why, correct?

            7     A.  I tried many times.  He stopped me, yeah.

            8     Q.  All right.

            9     A.  I complain about that.

           10     Q.  Well, now is your chance.  What did you want to explain

           11     to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury?

           12     A.  Okay.  That lecture, it was five years ago, okay, Santa

           13     Barbara.  That picture here shows on the left two lines, I

           14     think one red and one black.

           15     Q.  And you can touch the screen, if you want.

           16     A.  Okay.  These two lines here are different color, all

           17     right.  And let me, I mean, I'm going to have to reduce the

           18     jury to this, we have a figure, a graph, a plot of two

           19     lines.  The axis, which is the horizontal line in the axis,

           20     called K, that gives you how big the edges are, okay.  In

           21     the vertical line, it shows how much energy in each eddy.

           22     This eddy that comes from the room, some of them are

           23     stronger than others so energy -- and I have to say that

           24     plot, what we call the XCs, are on the log algorithm scale,

           25     log, log.  And I'm sorry to mention these words, but it's


 

                                                                             982



            1     important.

            2               And the two figures, if you have no particles in a

            3     room, like single air in this room, no squames, you will

            4     have the spectrum that is the black, and the colors here are

            5     not clear, but I can think like I'll put a finger here to

            6     try to say this, this one here, the upper, if you look on

            7     the left the upper curve is for a flow that has no

            8     particles.  The one underneath it, they intersect at some

            9     point, it has -- its written in particle laden flow.  It

           10     means you put dust or talc powder.

           11               When you have many of them, as I said earlier, it

           12     becomes two way coupling.  One-way coupling means the air in

           13     the operating room disburses squames but the number of

           14     squames, the volume is so small that they do not effect the

           15     turbine.  They just be carried like dust.  However, in many

           16     applications, in engineering and nature, you have many

           17     particle like they say a dust storm on Mars and they happen

           18     everyday.  These are huge amount of sand and the effect of

           19     the turbulence, it's also the turbulence become effected,

           20     and that is we call it two-way coupling means turbulence

           21     disburses particle and simultaneously the particles effect

           22     the flow.  That's a very tough problem, very difficult flow

           23     to analyze.

           24     Q.  So when Mr. Blackwell was asking you about whether or

           25     not LES --


 

                                                                             983



            1     A.  Right.  So --

            2     Q.  -- is suspect for turbulent flow and particles?

            3     A.  So the statement says, any large eddy simulation, LES,

            4     was particles I consider, that means if you have the red

            5     line instead of the black, that's a two-way coupling, you

            6     should not do that.  And before I did the simulation LES for

            7     this operating room, before anybody thinks any lawyer, any

            8     engineer, anybody, because this is my work for 40 years, I

            9     knew LES would be acceptable in this case because it's a

           10     one-way coupling.

           11     Q.  So this case is --

           12     A.  So two-way coupling, then I would never use it here.  I

           13     would say LES would not do it and that what I tried to

           14     explain to Mr. Brown.

           15     Q.  Mr. Blackwell.

           16     A.  Blackwell, yes.

           17     Q.  So he's asking you about --

           18     A.  Right.

           19     Q.  -- use of LES?

           20     A.  I just would like to add in 1994, 24 years ago, I wrote

           21     exactly what I told you now in a paper.  And I hope you have

           22     it, you can show it to them.  So it completely answers what

           23     Mr. -- one of the lawyers asked me.  I hope you can show it.

           24     Q.  Is this the paper you're talking about, Doctor?

           25     A.  Correct.


 

                                                                             984



            1     Q.  And this was written in?

            2     A.  Well, it was either in '92 -- or but appeared in '94,

            3     yes.

            4     Q.  Published in '94.  We're going to go all the way back.

            5     A.  Right, to the very end.  Yes.

            6     Q.  And is this part --

            7     A.  Yep, and I hope everybody in the room can read this.

            8     And I wrote this before anybody, anybody in the world

            9     perform a large eddy simulation that has particles.  Nobody.

           10     This is my whole idea.  So it shows here it is correct you

           11     use it in operating room but not when you have two-way

           12     couplings.  So in Santa Barbara, I was saying, guys, if you

           13     see two-coupling, don't use LES.  I was saying that.  And

           14     the lawyer prevented me from explaining that.

           15     Q.  All right.

           16               MR. BLACKWELL:  Your Honor, could I just ask what

           17     exhibit number this is?

           18               MS. ZIMMERMAN:  Here's a copy.

           19               THE COURT:  What's the exhibit number?  Exhibit

           20     number, please?

           21               MS. ZIMMERMAN:  I well look and see if we have an

           22     exhibit number on this, Your Honor.  We printed it from his

           23     CV.

           24               THE COURT:  I just need a number.  I don't need an

           25     explanation.


 

                                                                             985



            1               MS. ZIMMERMAN:  We'll follow-up with the Court for

            2     that.

            3     BY MS. ZIMMERMAN:

            4     Q.  Now Dr. Elghobashi, you explained to the jury earlier

            5     what your mesh was like?

            6     A.  Correct.

            7     Q.  Do you have images of what the mesh looked like in your

            8     paper?

            9     A.  Absolutely, yeah, but I don't have the paper, so you can

           10     show it if you have it.

           11               Right, so that's the mesh.  I don't know if you

           12     can see it because the picture is not very clear.

           13               You can see when you get to the edge, the drape

           14     edge of that, we have a very fine mesh.  Similarly in front

           15     of the medical staff or any wall or anything, you have to

           16     refine the mesh, and you have to test that many times by

           17     repeating the refinement until no change in the result.

           18     Then you can say I trust the results.  You cannot just pick

           19     a mesh and say run it and produce a paper.  We don't do the

           20     junk like that.

           21     Q.  And you did that in this case?

           22     A.  It's a requirement.  We teach the student to do that.

           23     That's necessary.

           24     Q.  All right.  And I was just asking you some questions

           25     about the airflow from the ceiling.


 

                                                                             986



            1     A.  Yes.

            2     Q.  And in your report you modelled that.  Is that right?

            3     A.  Correct.

            4     Q.  And you did that with both the Bair Hugger on and Bair

            5     Hugger off, right?

            6     A.  Correct.

            7     Q.  When you did it with the Bair Hugger off, where did the

            8     squames go?

            9     A.  Well, I think your video in the morning showed with the

           10     Bair Hugger off, they rise to some level, not very high, and

           11     when you turn the Bair Hugger on, they rise much higher.

           12     Q.  And we're just discussing the LES paper?

           13     A.  Yes.

           14     Q.  And that was 1994.  Was it possible to do this kind of

           15     LES analysis in '94?

           16     A.  Yeah, it would have been possible, but nobody asked me

           17     to do it, yes, but this is -- that statement I made in 1994

           18     was based on deep scientific understanding of two things,

           19     turbulence in general and when you put particles in

           20     turbulence.  This is not -- this is not a statement you do

           21     lightly because many students read that paper and they have

           22     to learn something, so you have to be very careful.  So this

           23     is based on my deep physical understanding of the phenomena

           24     of turbulence and what will happen to them if you put

           25     particles in them.


 

                                                                             987



            1     Q.  All right.  And you stand by the work that you did in

            2     this case?

            3     A.  Say it again?

            4     Q.  You stand by the work that you did in this case?

            5     A.  Absolutely, yeah.

            6     Q.  I don't have anything further, Doctor.

            7     A.  Thank you.

            8               THE COURT:  Thank you, Ms. Zimmerman.  Mr.

            9     Blackwell, did you have anything else?

           10               MR. BLACKWELL:  Briefly, Your Honor.

           11               THE COURT:  All right.

           12                         RECROSS EXAMINATION

           13     BY MR. BLACKWELL:

           14     Q.  Dr. Elghobashi, you just a few minutes ago made the

           15     statement that you put in the operating room all the

           16     ingredients that would distinguish between Bair Hugger on

           17     and Bair Hugger off.

           18     A.  Yes.

           19     Q.  That's not an all together true statement, is it, sir?

           20     A.  I couldn't hear you.

           21     Q.  That's not an all together true statement, is it?

           22     A.  Could you repeat it then?

           23     Q.  My question?

           24     A.  Yes, please.

           25     Q.  My question is that's not all together a true statement,


 

                                                                              988



            1     is it?

            2     A.  I want to know what the statement is, please.

            3     Q.  The statement is that you put in the operating room all

            4     of the ingredients that would distinguish between the Bair

            5     Hugger on and the Bair Hugger off?

            6     A.  Yes, I stand by statement, yes, I do.

            7     Q.  Let me just take an example of one.  For example, the

            8     return vents in operating room number 4, the real operating

            9     room.  Now, in your model, you assumed that these were

           10     passive air return vents, didn't you?

           11     A.  Could you please slowly and explain, because this is

           12     tricky points.  Which -- you talk about the grilles in our

           13     room or in the Providence room, which one?

           14     Q.  I'm talking about the grilles in operating room number 4

           15     where the surgery for Mr. Gareis took place on November 9,

           16     2010.

           17     A.  Right, yes.

           18     Q.  You assumed in your modelling that the vents, the air

           19     returns, were of the passive air return variety, didn't you?

           20     A.  Okay.  All right.  We have to define to the jury what

           21     passive air return means.  I know what it means, but you

           22     have to explain so I can answer you.

           23     Q.  Let me ask you to turn to the big book you have there

           24     once again.

           25     A.  Your book?


 

                                                                              989



            1     Q.  Yes, sir.

            2     A.  Okay, which page?

            3     Q.  And go to your deposition from February 10, 2018.

            4     A.  February 10th, yes, I have it.

            5     Q.  To page 221.  Starting down at line 25 at the bottom of

            6     the page of 221.

            7     A.  So I am in 221 on the bottom of that page.

            8     Q.  Line 25, yes, sir.

            9     A.  Line 25.  In the model, for the 505, 750, how do I

           10     continue?

           11     Q.  So here's -- I'll help it along.  The question was

           12     asked, In the model for the 505 and the 750, you answered

           13     yeah.  Question, is the return air, is it passive or is it

           14     powered, and your answered was passive?

           15     A.  All right.  So I knew --

           16     Q.  First I want to know, am I reading that correctly?

           17     A.  Correct.  But I'm saying you should explain to the

           18     people what passive means.  I know what it is.

           19     Q.  We're just going to keep going.

           20     A.  Okay.

           21     Q.  Because I want to first clarify that you assumed that

           22     the air return vent was passive?

           23     A.  Okay.

           24     Q.  And in OR number 4?

           25     A.  I agreed with you.  I said yes.


 

                                                                              990



            1     Q.  And do you agree with me that that assumption was in

            2     correct?

            3     A.  No.

            4     Q.  You didn't investigate whether the return vents in OR

            5     number 4 where Mr. Gareis surgery took place were powered or

            6     not and, in fact, you said with respect to that issue that

            7     you had no clue, in quotes.

            8     A.  I had no clue whether that, that operating room

            9     Providence has passive or powered, yeah, that's a true, I

           10     said I had no clue, not about the differences, not about

           11     what nobody told me.

           12     Q.  Sure.  Nobody told you --

           13     A.  Yes.

           14     Q.  -- that the air returns in operating room number 4 were

           15     not passive as you assumed, they were in fact powered with

           16     fan, you didn't know that, did you, sir?

           17     A.  I did not know details of the exit grilles in Providence

           18     operating room.

           19     Q.  And when we talk about there being a powered exit air

           20     vent, it means that there is a fan that is actively drawing

           21     air out of the room.  That's what powered means, doesn't it?

           22     A.  Are you explaining to me?  I know that.  I told you to

           23     explain to the people.  I know that.

           24     Q.  Oh, sure, we're doing it together.

           25     A.  Okay.


 

                                                                              991



            1     Q.  So the people will understand.

            2     A.  Okay.

            3     Q.  That when we are talking about the powered exhaust vent?

            4     A.  Yes.

            5     Q.  It means one that's powered by a fan that's actively

            6     drawing air out of the room?

            7     A.  Yes.

            8     Q.  So when you create a CFD model that has 3 million

            9     squames all over the floor, billowing up like a cloud, you

           10     were assuming that there was not a powered air return vent

           11     that was actively drawing the air out of room, true?

           12     A.  True, but it's irrelevant.  Irrelevant.

           13     Q.  Of course.  Thank you, Doctor.

           14     A.  Okay.

           15               THE COURT:  Anything else?  Thank you, sir.  You

           16     may step down.

           17               THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

           18               THE COURT:  Call your next witness.

           19               MS. PRUITT:  Your Honor, I believe the witness is

           20     David, and we would request that we be heard on our motion.

           21               THE COURT:  All right.  Do you have a different

           22     witness you could call --

           23               MR. FARRAR:  No, Your Honor.

           24               THE COURT:  -- while we consider that?

           25               MR. FARRAR:  We really don't.

            1               THE COURT:  All right.  Members of the jury, I

            2     need to talk to the lawyers a little bit here so I'm going

            3     to send you out and then we'll report shortly on the next

            4     steps.  Thank you very much.

            9                           (IN OPEN COURT)

           10               THE COURT:  Please be seated.  I received some

           11     briefing on this.  I've had some opportunity to review the

           12     briefs.  Let me ask plaintiffs for an offer of proof on what

           13     Mr. David's opinion is and whether his -- his opinion I

           14     gather would be that the Tablegard is a superior design,

           15     correct?

           16               MR. FARRAR:  Yes, Your Honor.  The focus of his

           17     opinions are going to be why is the Bair Hugger defective

           18     and that's going to be reliant on a lot of Elghobashi and

           19     other things and what a safer alternative design is, that

           20     being the Tablegard.

           21               THE COURT:  Right, the Tablegard.  And he's got a

           22     section in his report that talks about the Tablegard being a

           23     superior.

           24               MR. FARRAR:  Correct.

           25               THE COURT:  And so given that the report is not


 

                                                                             993



            1     written with the -- in mind excluding certain things that

            2     have been excluded, namely, one theory of the blowing out

            3     the dirty air, that's what I would like an offer of proof

            4     on.  What's the -- what admissible basis or what's his basis

            5     outside the excluded theory does he have her saying that

            6     Tablegard is superior?

            7               MR. FARRAR:  That it doesn't blow air so therefore

            8     it's not going to cause the same effect that Elghobashi just

            9     showed of the warm air being below the drapes and coming up.

           10               THE COURT:  Okay.  And that's in his report?

           11               MR. FARRAR:  That's in his report.

           12               THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.

           13               MR. HULSE:  Your Honor, may we be heard briefly on

           14     this.

           15               THE COURT:  Yes, I was just looking to see who --

           16               MR. HULSE:  Yes, I've been tagged.

           17               So, Your Honor, the issue is fundamentally the

           18     defect opinion that he gives.  It's not just an alternative

           19     design opinion.  He's separately got the defect opinion that

           20     the Bair Hugger is unreasonably dangerous and the basis that

           21     he comes to that opinion is substantially the reliance on

           22     the so-called dirty machine or crud and bug studies.  And he

           23     says that he -- that none of the studies that he relies on,

           24     this is page 31 of his report, by itself is sufficient to

           25     support his opinion.  They are only sufficient when they are


 

                                                                             994



            1     taken together.  So he has not offered and can't offer at

            2     this point a opinion, that opinion, the product defect

            3     opinion that it is unsafe, unreasonably dangerous for its

            4     intended use based on evidence that has been substantially

            5     excluded.  And, of course, you know, we've got the issue

            6     with Branham, the post-distribution evidence, you can't rely

            7     anything post April 22, 2009, to establish defect and that's

            8     also heavily what he relies on too.

            9               THE COURT:  Okay.  I am --

           10               MR. BLACKWELL:  Judge Ericksen, I'm sorry to

           11     interrupt the Court unexpectedly.

           12               THE COURT:  Hi.

           13               MR. BLACKWELL:  But Dr. David is still in the

           14     courtroom and don't know if it made sense that he be

           15     excused, given that he's the subject of this motion.

           16               THE COURT:  I can't remember what the exclusion

           17     order said, but if we had one, then I guess he ought leave,

           18     wherever he is.

           19               MR. FARRAR:  He's an expert so he's been here.

           20     Our exclusion order was experts were allowed to be in the

           21     courtroom and he's been in the courtroom.

           22               THE COURT:  Well, there he goes anyway.

           23               So as to your argument that post incident

           24     scientific studies may not be used, that argument is

           25     rejected.  I am interested in your -- in the arguments of


 

                                                                             995



            1     both counsel though on the question of whether excluding the

            2     -- I always forget what you call, should we call it the

            3     dirty machine theory.  Taking out the dirty machine theory,

            4     what do we have that is sufficiently supported and also is

            5     adequately disclosed?

            6               MR. HULSE:  And, Your Honor, if I could just refer

            7     the Court to page 4 of our brief and the chart that we have

            8     which lists specifically the studies that are subject to

            9     motion in limine 2, which is what we're calling today the

           10     dirty machine, the dirty machine motion.  So it relates too

           11     large number.  It's the majority of the studies that he

           12     relies upon to form his defect opinion.  And what he doesn't

           13     offer anywhere in his report and didn't offer anywhere in

           14     his deposition testimony is the testimony he could still

           15     have reached the same conclusion if he had excluded those

           16     studies and simply just relied on airflow.  And in his

           17     report, he doesn't rely on, unless I'm mistaken, he didn't

           18     rely on Dr. Elghobashi so --

           19               THE COURT:  I don't see that.  I don't see it

           20     listed so I --

           21               MR. HULSE:  No.  And if he were to do that, that

           22     would be a new opinion.  And if he were to say I'll offer an

           23     opinion based exclusively on airflow studies, that would be

           24     in the new opinion that was never disclosed under Rule 26A

           25     either, so we'd be hearing it here for the first time.


 

                                                                             996



            1               THE COURT:  An admissible opinion would be the

            2     Tablegard is a superior warming device because it does not

            3     disrupt airflow, and I know that you have issues with that

            4     because of your interpretation of Branham, and you might be

            5     right about that, but for present purposes I am ruling

            6     against you on that.  So the question for me is whether

            7     Dr. David or Mr. David --

            8               MR. HULSE:  He is a doctor.

            9               THE COURT:  I don't know what all those initials,

           10     I guess that's the EDPCEE, some of that equals doctor.

           11               MR. HULSE:  That's right.

           12               THE COURT:  So Dr. David somewhere in here gives

           13     the opinion that the Tablegard is superior because it does

           14     not disrupt airflow, and I may be asking the wrong person in

           15     terms of somebody else at your table, but maybe I ought to

           16     be asking the other table that question.

           17               MR. HULSE:  I defer to them.

           18               THE COURT:  Thanks.

           19               MR. FARRAR:  Are you there, Your Honor?  I didn't

           20     want to interrupt your --

           21               THE COURT:  Yep, thanks very much.

           22               MR. FARRAR:  Sure.

           23               THE COURT:  I'm ready to hear from you.  I think I

           24     think I have managed to articulate the question.

           25               MR. FARRAR:  I completely understand what you're


 

                                                                             997



            1     asking.  So the answer is yes, page 8 of his report he says

            2     well, I guess the Bair Hugger could pose a risk in this area

            3     in two ways, this area being surgery surgical site

            4     infections.  First is the Bair Hugger would pose an

            5     infection risk if it's disrupted or interfered with the

            6     ventilation system used in the clean environment of an

            7     orthopedic operating theater.  So that's his first way that

            8     there's mechanism of injury, if you will.  That's the risk.

            9     He discusses safer alternative designs, other potential

           10     alteratives.  And he says on page 38, it is my opinion that

           11     more likely than not there are safer alternative designs

           12     which are as effective as the Bair Hugger.

           13               And he goes threw sort of his analysis and how he

           14     does it, and one of the ones he specifically talks about is

           15     the Tablegard.  So he gives the mechanism of injury and he

           16     says this is a safer alternative design, and that's

           17     basically what he's going to testify to here today, the

           18     implication is this doesn't have the same mechanism of

           19     injury, that's why it's a safer alternative design.

           20               THE COURT:  Okay.  Defendants say, or are going to

           21     say maybe, that that opinion, that the opinion that the

           22     Tablegard represents a safer alternative design because it

           23     does not disrupt the airflow, even though its referred to in

           24     that first full paragraph on page 8 and is included in the

           25     opinions, that that as a standalone opinion would be new,


 

                                                                             998



            1     and I think that they're saying from their reference to all

            2     the, somewhere in their brief or maybe even today, they said

            3     he says I put these all together, nothing all by itself is

            4     enough to make me form that opinion so --

            5               MR. FARRAR:  I think page 39 may answer.

            6               THE COURT:  Okay.

            7               MR. FARRAR:  And page 39, there's the picture of

            8     the Tablegard sort of it's on the left side, if you will.

            9               THE COURT:  I see it.

           10               MR. FARRAR:  Right next to the sentence beginning

           11     with however.

           12               THE COURT:  However, the Tablegard system used a

           13     closed circulation system.

           14               And so you're going to say that it's adequately

           15     disclosed because that whole paragraph begins with a

           16     statement, another alternative design which is more likely

           17     than not safer as a factor.

           18               MR. FARRAR:  Sure, it continues on the next page,

           19     there's a couple more paragraphs, and I'll let the Court

           20     read it, but clearly he has disclosed that is a safer

           21     alternative design because it's a recirculating system that

           22     doesn't blow air into a sterile field.

           23               THE COURT:  Mr. Hulse, that's -- I'm persuaded by

           24     that, I think, unless there's --

           25               MR. HULSE:  Let me see if I can un-persuade you.


 

                                                                             999



            1               THE COURT:  Okay, yep, that's why I'm wanting to

            2     hear from you.

            3               MR. HULSE:  You have to, of course, put feasible

            4     safer alternative design together with the rest of the

            5     product defect analysis.  The reason that he has concluded

            6     that that the Bair Hugger is defective is based on the crud

            7     and bug studies, and he specifically references here no

            8     introduction of airflow to the sterile field or contact with

            9     the patient's skin.

           10               THE COURT:  I'm sorry, where are you reading?

           11               MR. HULSE:  That's page 39.  So this is what

           12     Mr. Farrar was just reading.  Or contact with the patient's

           13     skin.  This is the blowing bacteria theory.  So his reason

           14     that he's concluded it's safer is that it doesn't introduce

           15     airflow to the sterile field or basically blow bacteria on

           16     the patient's skin.  That's the basis for him saying that it

           17     is in fact safer than the Bair Hugger than relating back to

           18     the studies where on page 31, he says while the individual

           19     results of these studies are not definitive collectively,

           20     they support the conclusion that the Bair Hugger has the

           21     potential to cause surgical site infections in orthopedic

           22     surgeries.

           23               Another thing that we believe he'll testify is

           24     there is a cartoon drawing that was done at 3M in 2014, a

           25     sketch for a recirculating air, and what will be shown when


 

                                                                             1000



            1     they show that is it's a self-cleaning system.  If they

            2     display this sketch as proof of feasibility of this design

            3     that the Bair Hugger could be altered to do it, this is a

            4     sketch or an idea that was responding specifically to

            5     Augustine's dirty machine, crud and bug theory.  It's called

            6     a self-cleaning system that would prevented, the idea being

            7     if it were actually true, that the bugs would get out and

            8     onto the patient.  So that's going to be their proof of the

            9     feasibility of this system, it's a self-cleaning concept

           10     that was to respond to the dirty machines allegations.

           11               THE COURT:  I don't know that that is what they

           12     are planning.  I think the feasibility would be proven just

           13     by the fact that it was -- it got the clearance, the FDA

           14     clearance.

           15               MR. HULSE:  We assume that would be inadmissible

           16     under -- on your ruling.

           17               THE COURT:  Just the fact that it was -- we need

           18     something for purposes of the statute of limitations.

           19               MR. HULSE:  Well, we haven't been allowed to tell

           20     the jury that our product was cleared and so it would

           21     certainly be prejudicial for them to hear that this product

           22     was cleared.

           23               THE COURT:  Well, then you'd be able to show that

           24     your -- I mean, you obviously can't show that one's cleared

           25     and one's not, but there's a difference between showing that


 

                                                                             1001



            1     it's cleared and getting into the whole, you know, the FDA

            2     says we're fine, therefore, let hey, jury, let's read

            3     something into that and put some weight in that but for,

            4     especially statute of limitations purposes, to say, look,

            5     here's a date on which there was something and we know that

            6     because that's the date it was cleared, that would be

            7     permitted.

            8               It may be, and let me hear from both of you on the

            9     question of whether, given that we do not have a written

           10     opinion from Dr. David saying that his opinion would be the

           11     same even if he didn't consider any of the excluded

           12     material, maybe he was not -- maybe it's not even his

           13     opinion.

           14               MR. HULSE:  We don't know.

           15               THE COURT:  Mr. Farrar, should we have a

           16     testimonial offer of proof outside the hearing of the jury?

           17               MR. FARRAR:  I think it's sort of easy, Your

           18     Honor.  I mean, as far as when the Tablegard came on the

           19     market, we're just go say, I'm going to show my intent was

           20     either to show him the 510K or just ask him, when was it on

           21     the market, not cleared.

           22               THE COURT:  Yeah, fine, you're not going to put in

           23     the cartoon from 3M about that --

           24               MR. FARRAR:  I am -- it's not a cartoon.  I want

           25     to show that 3M also had the same design concepts internally


 

                                                                             1002



            1     and never implemented them.  I do want to show that.

            2               THE COURT:  No, that's excluded, right.  And so

            3     that's excluded --

            4               MR. FARRAR:  I'll make a quick offer on it.  I

            5     know you can exclude, but I need it for my appellate record

            6     purposes.

            7               THE COURT:  Right.  Right.

            8               MR. FARRAR:  The main thing that Dr. David is

            9     going to rely upon for his opinions is really the work for

           10     Dr. Elghobashi which is in his report as reviewed and he sat

           11     in here in court.  The advisory notes to Rule 703

           12     specifically talk about --

           13               THE COURT:  I know, but where in his report does

           14     he talk about Dr. Elghobashi?

           15               MR. FARRAR:  There is a section entitled, and it's

           16     Plaintiffs' Exhibit 702, materials reviewed.

           17               THE COURT:  Is that in -- I've got the report in

           18     front of me.

           19               MR. FARRAR:  It's probably not in your copy.

           20               THE COURT:  It's a long list, isn't it?

           21               MR. FARRAR:  Your Honor, I'm not positive it's in

           22     your copy, but it's on page 49 in his report if your

           23     report --

           24               THE COURT:  Let me see if my numbers go up that

           25     high.  I have a page 49 and it says expert reports, Dr. Said


 

                                                                             1003



            1     Elghobashi.

            2               MR. FARRAR:  Correct.

            3               THE COURT:  Must be only one of those.

            4               MR. HULSE:  Your Honor, I would add, there is zero

            5     reference to it anywhere in the body of the report as a

            6     basis for his defect opinion.  He may have in fact

            7     considered it, but he nowhere describes it as an actual

            8     basis for his opinion.

            9               THE COURT:  I would like to hear from Dr. David

           10     briefly outside the hearing of the jury to find out whether

           11     he even does hold the opinion that we're all assuming that

           12     he's going to testify to.

           13               MR. FARRAR:  He does, Your Honor, and if you would

           14     give me a bit of guidance of what exactly you want to hear,

           15     just what his opinion is and the basis thereof?

           16               Yes?  Okay I'll go grab him.

           17               MR. HULSE:  Your Honor, I'll turn it over to

           18     Ms. Pruitt.

           19         (Witness sworn.)

           20               THE COURT:  Please take the witness stand.

           21     Mr. Farrar.

           22               MR. FARRAR:  Thanks.  Your Honor, I assume you

           23     don't want to hear about qualifications necessarily at this

           24     point, just kind of jump to the meat of it?

           25               THE COURT:  No, just get to the point.


 

                                                                             1004



            1               MR. FARRAR:  I will.

            2               (Without jury present)

            3                        VOIR DIRE EXAMINATION

            4     BY MR. FARRAR:

            5     Q.  Can you introduce yourself, please?

            6     A.  My name is Yadin David.  David is my last name.

            7     Q.  Dr. David, we're going to sort of jump to the point real

            8     quick for the Court.  So I want to talk about your core

            9     opinions in this case.  You were asked to do a hazard

           10     analysis of the Bair Hugger; is that right?

           11     A.  Correct.

           12     Q.  What is a hazard analysis?

           13     A.  Hazard analysis is review of the feature and performance

           14     of a product relative to human well-being.

           15     Q.  One of the things --

           16               MR. FARRAR:  And if you don't mind I'm going to

           17     lead to sort of speed it up, Your Honor.

           18     BY MR. FARRAR:

           19     Q.  One of the things that I know that you look for is the

           20     function, the operation, and the environment of use.  Is

           21     that correct?

           22     A.  Those three things, correct.

           23     Q.  Did you do that in this case for the Bair Hugger?

           24     A.  I did.

           25     Q.  What is the function as you understand it?


 

                                                                             1005



            1     A.  Function is the intended use of the product, sometime

            2     you can find it in submission to government agencies, but

            3     basically, it is what the product design is supposed to do

            4     to benefit the user.

            5     Q.  And in this case, that would be patient warming,

            6     correct?

            7     A.  Correct.

            8     Q.  The operation is basically how the device works,

            9     correct?

           10     A.  How do you apply it, correct.

           11     Q.  What is your understanding of the operation of the Bair

           12     Hugger?

           13     A.  My understanding is that the product has a heating

           14     element fan that drive the air from the outside of the

           15     device, direct it through a hose to a blanket that has

           16     perforation directing to the patient's skin and the heated

           17     air warming the patient during surgical procedure.

           18     Q.  What type of heating is that known as?

           19     A.  That is convection.

           20     Q.  Okay.  Environment of use, what is your understanding of

           21     the environment of use of the Bair Hugger?

           22     A.  Environment of use is how do you use a product in the

           23     particular intended intention of receiving the benefits, and

           24     there can be varied form area of the hospital to another

           25     area of hospital or now you have also home care, so the


 

                                                                             1006



            1     environment of use is important factor in understanding the

            2     hazard.

            3     Q.  What was the environment of use you were looking at in

            4     your hazard analysis?

            5     A.  The environment in this case was specifically operating

            6     room that is used for deep joint orthopedic procedures.

            7     Q.  And you talked about the hazard.  What is the hazard

            8     that you were examining for the Bair Hugger?

            9     A.  That's the product take increase the unsafe condition of

           10     the patient when it's used in this particular environment in

           11     this function.

           12     Q.  What specific injury were you looking for?

           13     A.  Is the amount of exposure to pathogens is increased when

           14     the product is in use.

           15     Q.  And in your investigation in the type of work you do, is

           16     it common for you to rely on other experts in other fields?

           17     A.  Oh, yeah, absolutely.

           18     Q.  In this case did you rely on other experts in others

           19     field as well?

           20     A.  Yes, this is routine work.  This -- my field is very

           21     wide and impossible to have expertise in every single

           22     aspect.

           23     Q.  Did you rely in part on your work in -- on the work of

           24     Dr. Elghobashi?

           25     A.  I did.


 

                                                                             1007



            1     Q.  Did you have a chance to review his expert reports?

            2     A.  I did.

            3     Q.  You've seen his videos?

            4     A.  I did.

            5     Q.  And were you able to sit here in trial and watch his

            6     testimony all day today?

            7     A.  I did.

            8     Q.  After watching his -- reviewing his work and watching

            9     and listening to his testimony, did you come to an opinion

           10     as to a mechanism of risk of deep joint infections caused by

           11     the Bair Hugger?

           12     A.  I did.

           13     Q.  What was that?

           14     A.  Simply illustrated in his analysis and demonstration of

           15     the video is that when the Bair Hugger is operated in

           16     surgical procedure, the amount of pathogen carried by a

           17     different particular is significantly increased in the wound

           18     area.

           19     Q.  You understand that the air that's coming out of the

           20     perforations in the Bair Hugger are -- it's not a closed

           21     system, they go into the operating room, the air does?

           22     A.  Correct.

           23     Q.  Okay.  Did you have chance to do an investigation as to

           24     whether the whether or not there was a safer alternative

           25     design to the Bair Hugger?


 

                                                                             1008



            1     A.  I did.

            2     Q.  How do you define safer alternative design?

            3     A.  Safer alternative design, just like the words are

            4     standing for, is a different construction or different

            5     design or a change that will make the application of the

            6     product less hazardous, more safe for the procedure.

            7     Q.  So for this particular I guess device, you would look at

            8     something that would warm a patient up intraoperatively

            9     without the risk of the disruption of the unidirectional

           10     flow in the operating room?

           11     A.  Correct.

           12     Q.  All right.  And were you able to find such a device?

           13     A.  I did.

           14     Q.  What device did you find?

           15     A.  I found several examples.  They are ranging in principal

           16     of operation from an electrical material that is being

           17     heated not using forced air at all to a similar product that

           18     are using forced air like the Bair Hugger but collect the

           19     air back in the circuit, enclosed circuit, that means they

           20     deliver the air to the patient but do not let it dispose

           21     into the operating room environment but collected and

           22     recirculating it.

           23     Q.  A recirculating system?

           24     A.  Correct.

           25     Q.  And what's the name of the product that you found?


 

                                                                             1009



            1     A.  One of them would be Tablegard.

            2     Q.  Okay.  The Tablegard heats convectively or conductively?

            3     A.  Two different means of transferring heat.  It does heat

            4     the patient conductively by the patient touching the blanket

            5     that is being warmed by circulating air that is heated.

            6     Q.  Did you do any research as to whether or not this type

            7     of convective heating is as effective at warming a patient

            8     as convective heating like the Bair Hugger?

            9     A.  I did.

           10     Q.  What did you find?

           11     A.  I looked at a article and deposition including from the

           12     3M manufacturing circuit and identify that the alternative

           13     design is similar to forced air as far as ability to warm

           14     patients.

           15     Q.  Did you -- do you have an opinion to a reasonable degree

           16     of biomedical engineering as to whether or not the Tablegard

           17     would disrupt the airflow in the operating room the same way

           18     Dr. Elghobashi's CFD model showed the Bair Hugger would?

           19     A.  It probably would not because there is no air being --

           20     hot air being dispensed from the instrument in the

           21     surrounding area of the surgical environment.

           22     Q.  And do you hold that opinion to a reasonable degree of

           23     biomedical --

           24     A.  Engineering, yes.

           25     Q.  Okay.  Did you do an analysis as to whether or not the


 

                                                                             1010



            1     Tablegard was both technologically and economically feasible

            2     in 2009?

            3     A.  I did.

            4     Q.  Was it on the market in 2009?

            5     A.  It was.

            6     Q.  Was it technologically and economically feasible in

            7     2009?

            8     A.  Yes.  It's basically a similar product that has heating

            9     element, a fan that's circulating air, with the exception

           10     that it collects the air and bring it back to the

           11     instrument.

           12               MR. FARRAR:  And, Your Honor, my proffer obviously

           13     would be in more detail at trial, but I think I'm trying to

           14     get sort of the gist of it out for you.

           15               THE COURT:  Okay.  Somebody over here.  Ms.

           16     Pruitt.

           17                          CROSS EXAMINATION

           18     BY MS. PRUITT:

           19     Q.  Hello, Dr. David.  I'm Lynn Pruitt.  You've never

           20     designed a patient warming system, have you, sir?

           21     A.  I did not.

           22     Q.  And you've never built a patient warming system, have

           23     you?

           24     A.  I did not.

           25     Q.  And you did not attempt to modify the Bair Hugger system


 

                                                                             1011



            1     to incorporate the Tablegard design, did you, sir?

            2     A.  It would be illegal for me to do that.

            3     Q.  And you didn't try to do it on a protocol either, did

            4     you, sir?

            5     A.  I didn't see a purpose to do that.

            6     Q.  Okay.  And you did not attempt to modify the Bair Hugger

            7     system to incorporate the recirculation of the air, did you,

            8     sir?

            9     A.  I didn't have to do it.  3M have a project to do that.

           10     Q.  And you did not at tempt to modify the Bair Hugger

           11     system to use non-perforated blankets, did you, sir?

           12     A.  Once again, it would be illegal for me to modify medical

           13     equipment.

           14     Q.  And you didn't develop a protocol of a system like the

           15     Bair Hugger that used non-perforated blankets, did you, sir?

           16     A.  That was not part of my assignment.

           17     Q.  And there's no data, you're aware of no data to show

           18     whether your proposed modification to the Bair Hugger system

           19     of recirculation would render it less effective at warming

           20     patients, are you, sir?

           21     A.  There are studies, including deposition from 3M clinical

           22     trial director I think was his title, that stated that, so I

           23     didn't have to study it.

           24     Q.  And you're referring to a document of 3M.  What's the

           25     date on that document?


 

                                                                             1012



            1     A.  In the last four year I reviewed probably 5,000

            2     documents.  I don't think I can remember a date of one

            3     single document.

            4     Q.  Okay.  And you have no idea what the impact on cost of

            5     modifying the Bair Hugger system to do this recirculation,

            6     you don't know what that would be, do you, sir?

            7     A.  I do.

            8     Q.  You do?

            9     A.  I do.

           10     Q.  What would that be?

           11     A.  As a matter of fact, 3M has a project I believe called

           12     Ducky that is looking at conception of design to achieve

           13     exactly that same idea of recirculating, and what they have

           14     shown is that they had to add minimal number of component

           15     and slight change in design that will not be economically

           16     unrealistic.

           17     Q.  And you referring to something that the Judge is

           18     familiar with called Project Ducky?

           19     A.  I do.

           20     Q.  You've never tested, Dr. David, the Tablegard's warming

           21     capabilities, have you?

           22     A.  Tested the warming capability?  No, it is reported in

           23     articles and in their literature.

           24     Q.  And which article is it that's in your report, sir, in

           25     your list of materials upon which you rely to say that the


 

                                                                             1013



            1     Tablegard is just as effective as the Bair Hugger in warming

            2     patients?

            3     A.  I believe that I cited the brochure that stated

            4     specifically that language.

            5     Q.  Whose brochure?

            6     A.  Tablegard brochure.

            7     Q.  Is it a marketing brochure?

            8     A.  It is.

            9     Q.  Have you ever operated Tablegard, sir?

           10     A.  No, I did not.

           11     Q.  Have you ever seen a Tablegard in person?

           12     A.  Besides photograph?

           13     Q.  Beside the photograph.  In person.

           14     A.  No.

           15     Q.  Do you have any idea, Dr. David, whether orthopedic

           16     surgeons would be willing to use this proposed modified Bair

           17     Hugger system in total hip replacement surgeries?

           18     A.  I'm not a physician.  I believe they do because this is

           19     a product that has been fully designed, tested, completed,

           20     and put to the market and received approval and being used.

           21     Q.  Can you name a doctor, an orthopedic surgeon, sir, or a

           22     hospital that uses a Tablegard in total hip replacement

           23     surgeries?

           24     A.  I didn't pursue that type of research.

           25     Q.  And you cannot say, Dr. David, whether this proposed


 

                                                                             1014



            1     alternate design would have prevented the plaintiff's deep

            2     joint infection, can you, sir?

            3     A.  Since I'm not a clinician, that's not the area of my

            4     expertise, but I can say that it will not contribute to the

            5     phenomena we have seen in Elghobashi presentation.

            6     Q.  And I heard you mention that in your testimony just a

            7     minute ago, and you used the word pathogens.  The testimony

            8     of Elghobashi had nothing to do with pathogen, did it, sir?

            9     A.  Well, he referred, was another name to particulates but,

           10     the physical phenomena is similar.

           11     Q.  I would refer you, if I could for just a minute, to your

           12     report, Dr. David, on page 31?

           13               MS. PRUITT:  May I approach, Your Honor?

           14               THE COURT:  You may.

           15     BY MS. PRUITT:

           16     Q.  If you look at that paragraph.  Are all the studies that

           17     you relied upon for these opinions you've just given either

           18     in your expert report or in the materials relied upon

           19     section?

           20     A.  If you will give me a minute, I'll read it.

           21               Okay.  And what's the question?

           22     Q.  The question is, looking at that paragraph, sir, you

           23     state that while the individual results of these studies are

           24     not definitive, collectively, they support the conclusion

           25     that the Bair Hugger has the potential to cause surgical


 

                                                                             1015



            1     site infections in orthopedic surgeries.  Did I read that

            2     correctly?

            3     A.  You did.

            4     Q.  And if you'll flip back with me, please, sir, to

            5     page 27, where you begin to cite studies, and if you will

            6     look at the first study that you cited, it's dated 2004 on

            7     page 27; is that correct?

            8     A.  It looks like the first study is dated 2002.

            9     Q.  Okay.  Thank you.  The first study is dated 2002.  And

           10     that particular study discusses the filter in that

           11     particular study; is that correct?

           12               Do you see the first bullet, heavy growth of

           13     bacteria found on forced air warming units, is that what

           14     that study is looking at?

           15     A.  It's like a memory test for me.  I don't recall the

           16     particular of the study, but I would agree with you that

           17     this first bullet suggest it.

           18     Q.  Okay.  And then the second study is dated 2004, and this

           19     also has to do with contaminated filters and being a

           20     secondary source of transmission if you look at bullet two.

           21     Is that right?

           22     A.  That's what bullet two states.

           23     Q.  And again, on the next page, page 28, this study dated

           24     2009 by Leaper, this study also is about contaminated

           25     bacterial growth in a machine.  Is that correct?  Based on


 

                  David - Voir Dire Examination by The Court                 1016



            1     your first bullet point.

            2     A.  The blower surface, yes.

            3     Q.  Okay.  Now, if you look real quickly for me, please,

            4     sir, at the rest of the studies on 28; they're dated 2009,

            5     2011; and on page 29, 2011, 2012, 2012; and on page 30,

            6     2013, 2013, and 2013; on page 31, 2014 and 2016.  Those are

            7     the 13 studies upon which you relied to give your opinions

            8     that you've given here in court today; is that correct?

            9     A.  Well, in addition to other material, that's correct.

           10     Q.  Okay.  And your testimony in your report is that after

           11     considering all of those collectively, that you could reach

           12     your opinions, correct?

           13     A.  Those and the other material I reviewed, correct.

           14               MS. PRUITT:  That's all I have, Your Honor.

           15               MR. FARRAR:  No further questions.

           16                          COURT EXAMINATION

           17     BY THE COURT:

           18     Q.  So your report talks a lot about bacteria and the

           19     materials that you got from 3M had to do with bacteria.  Is

           20     that right?

           21     A.  It had to do with that as well, yes.

           22     Q.  If you did not take into account bacteria supposedly

           23     coming from getting out of the Bair Hugger, you know, and

           24     then getting out, if you just totally excluded that, what

           25     would that do to your opinion about whether the Tablegard is


 

                  David - Voir Dire Examination by The Court                 1017



            1     a reasonable alternative?  Do you still have the same

            2     opinion even if you exclude all the bacteria information?

            3     A.  Yes, Your Honor.  My report is stating that there is two

            4     phenomena that I addressed.  One is relating to the bacteria

            5     that you described well.  If you exclude all that, the other

            6     part, the other point I'm making is that forced air is

            7     changing the environment around orthopedics procedure to the

            8     point that removing those movement of air would reduce the

            9     hazard, so the Tablegard does not continue that, would

           10     contribute to a safer orthopedics procedure operating room.

           11     Q.  And doing these hazard analyses, that's what you do for

           12     your actual non- litigation living?

           13     A.  Correct.  I'm a Diplomate and Board-certified forensic

           14     engineer.

           15               THE COURT:  All right.  Thanks.  That's all the

           16     questions I have for you, thank you.

           17               Anybody else, while we're outside the hearing of

           18     the jury, with this witness or should we have him step down?

           19               MR. FARRAR:  I have no questions Your Honor.

           20               MS. PRUITT:  Your Honor, I'd just like to point

           21     out that his reference to electric blankets is referring to

           22     the HotDog and, secondly, his reference to internal company

           23     documents, at least what I just heard was Project Ducky, and

           24     both of those have been excluded by the Court.  So I'm going

           25     to try not to be objecting, interrupting but those are not


 

                                                                             1018



            1     permissible, admissible evidence upon which he can rely for

            2     this opinion.

            3               THE COURT:  So just so you understood the question

            4     that I asked earlier, if you don't take into account

            5     anything having to do with Ducky and you don't take into

            6     account this HotDog, does that change your opinion?

            7               THE WITNESS:  No, what that create is that two of

            8     my points are reduced to one, so I have one point about

            9     forcing air in the orthopedic surgery room, and that is the

           10     one.

           11               THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you?

           12               Did you have any more questions?  Okay.  All

           13     right.  Thank you.  You can step down.

           14               THE WITNESS:  Should I leave the room?

           15               THE COURT:  It's up to the lawyers.

           16               It's a close one, but I'll let him testify to this

           17     restricted opinion, but you've got to be careful you don't

           18     try and get in -- or that you don't allow him to become a

           19     conduit for inadmissible material.

           20               Now, do you folks need a little break before we

           21     get started?  We've got 45 minutes left before we have --

           22               MR. FARRAR:  I would really like one, Your Honor.

           23               THE COURT:  Sure.  Yeah, no, that's fine.  We'll

           24     take just a couple of minutes and then we'll bring the jury

           25     back.  And I'll send somebody in to make sure that you're

           16                          DIRECT EXAMINATION

           17     BY MR. FARRAR:

           18     Q.  Dr. David, I know you just introduced yourself, but

           19     would you do it again?

           20     A.  Sure.

           21     Q.  Actually, a better question.  What do you do for a

           22     living, sir?

           23     A.  I'm a biomedical engineer.

           24     Q.  What is a biomedical engineer?

           25     A.  A biomedical engineer is a professional who trained and


 

                                                                             1020



            1     academically prepared to apply engineering principles to

            2     solve life sciences problem.  In short, it is finding

            3     solution to health care problem using technology.

            4     Q.  What were you asked to do in this case?

            5     A.  I was asked to review the potential of an extent of

            6     hazard associated with the Bair Hugger during orthopedic

            7     procedure.

            8     Q.  Okay.  And I want to talk a little bit about your

            9     education, what you did to academically to get where you're

           10     at, so if you would tell me about your education.

           11     A.  Sure.  I did my associate of science degree in

           12     electrical engineering, continued to obtain my bachelor of

           13     science in electrical engineering in 1974, came to the

           14     United States to pursue a higher education, did my master in

           15     electrical engineering with biomedical engineering emphasis

           16     and then continued to obtain my doctorate in education.

           17     Q.  Where did you get your master's degree?

           18     A.  My first degree was obtained in Israel and all the

           19     others were in West Virginia University here in the country.

           20     Q.  So your master's and your doctorate was at West

           21     Virginia?

           22     A.  Correct.

           23     Q.  When did you obtain your doctorate degree?

           24     A.  1982.

           25     Q.  I understand there's a difference between a Ph.D.,


 

                                                                             1021



            1     there's another type of doctorate.  Can you tell me which

            2     one you are and what's the difference?

            3     A.  Yeah, there are many doctors out there.  I play on the

            4     television, but I'm not one.  I'm an EDD, which is doctorate

            5     in education.  I study education psychology and my research

            6     is about how a doc learner can understand the principle of

            7     safety, specifically, I study how to train nurses and

            8     physician about safety of medical product.

            9     Q.  And I know when folks get their Ph.D., there's a -- I'm

           10     blanking on the word -- a thesis?

           11     A.  A research thesis, yes.

           12     Q.  Did you have one for your EED?

           13     A.  Correct.

           14     Q.  Is that what that was about teaching doctors and nurses

           15     how to use equipment?

           16     A.  Exactly.  Safely.

           17     Q.  Safely.  It's a key.  How did you get interested in

           18     biomedical engineering?

           19     A.  I was a full-time student and a full-time employee

           20     during my academic career, and funding myself and my family

           21     while going to school.  So I worked at the nighttime, the

           22     graveyard shift what they call it at the hospital, and

           23     during the day, I was going to school.  And when I was

           24     walking the hospital corridors during night, I noticed that

           25     medical equipment does not get the attention it should.  It


 

                                                                             1022



            1     is left in hallways and in operating room.  It's getting

            2     kicked around by cleaning instruments, vacuum, floor vacuum,

            3     et cetera, and I got concerned that what if I'll be in one

            4     of those operating room being treated by the anesthesia

            5     machine earlier this morning, they talk about cautery or

            6     ventilators and are not going to be in good condition, and I

            7     wanted to understand how to make medical equipment or

            8     medical devices safer.

            9     Q.  When you started out at the University of West Virginia

           10     Hospital, was it the West Virginia University Hospital, am I

           11     saying it right?

           12     A.  Correct.

           13     Q.  What was your position?

           14     A.  I was operating room orderly.

           15     Q.  How long did you work there?

           16     A.  I worked there from 1975 until 1982.

           17     Q.  That's while you were a student at West Virginia?

           18     A.  Correct.

           19     Q.  When you left, when you finally graduated with your EED,

           20     what was your position at the hospital?

           21     A.  I was Director of Biomedical Engineering Program.

           22     Q.  So you worked your way from orderly to Director of

           23     Biomechanical Engineering while you were a student?

           24     A.  Except it was Biomedical Engineering.

           25     Q.  Biomedical, I'm sorry.  Tell me what a biomedical


 

                                                                             1023



            1     engineer department that you're the director of at a

            2     hospital like West Virginia University, what do you do?

            3     A.  It's very simple.  If you look at Bair Hugger or any

            4     medical device, there is a life cycle associated with the

            5     product.  There is a concept, idea, somebody saying, oh, I

            6     just came with this bullet, silver bullet going to help the

            7     world.  And you need to go into manufacturing, design, and

            8     going through appropriate approvals and then marketing and

            9     put it in use.  Then you have to educate user how to use it.

           10     You have to service, maintain and calibrate it, apply

           11     upgrades over time until it's obsolete and the new product

           12     start the cycle, to decide when to dispose and say you're

           13     obsolete, my friend.

           14     Q.  Somebody has made a better mouse trap?

           15     A.  Yes, exactly.

           16     Q.  You graduated with your EED would you say in '84?

           17     A.  '82, I said.

           18     Q.  '82.  What did you do after you graduated?

           19     A.  A head hunter called me up from the Texas Medical Center

           20     and said come down do an interview for the open position of

           21     Director of Biomedical Instrumentation Department.  I told

           22     my wife, you know, this is the largest medical center in the

           23     world.  I will never get a job there, but at the same time

           24     I'll never have a chance to see such a place from Biomedical

           25     Engineering Department or the view, so I'm going down to


 

                                                                             1024



            1     interview.  But in essence, I'm going to be educating myself

            2     how the big guys are doing it.

            3     Q.  What were the doctors?  Who are the doctors?

            4     A.  Dr. Cooley, Dr. DeBakey, two of the most famous heart

            5     surgeons in the world.  They invented artificial hearts, and

            6     it was just unbelievable environment of innovation and

            7     technology.

            8     Q.  Well, how did the interview go?

            9     A.  Apparently well, because I got the job.

           10     Q.  What position did you take?  The Texas Medical Center,

           11     that's in Houston, right?

           12     A.  Correct.

           13     Q.  What position did you take?

           14     A.  So I took the Director of Biomedical Instrumentation

           15     Department.

           16     Q.  Director of Biomedical instrumentation?

           17     A.  Instrumentation.

           18     Q.  Can you tell me what that job entails?

           19     A.  At that time, it was basically a machine shop.  A bunch

           20     of engineers and clinicians were responsible for repairing,

           21     maintaining medical equipment.  And I turned it into what's

           22     called biomedical engineering department where you have

           23     engineer principle of looking at the life cycles, how do you

           24     make decision what to buy, what to retire, and what's in

           25     between?  And convert the department to the point where we


 

                                                                             1025



            1     were actually developing product.  We have several patents

            2     were issued, several product that were put out in the market

            3     because of our work, published papers, et cetera.

            4     Q.  How long were you at the Texas Medical Center?

            5     A.  I was there for 25 years and then retired and decided to

            6     start my own business basically doing the same.

            7     Q.  I want to talk to you a little bit more about the work

            8     at the medical center and ask you, Dr. David, do hospitals

            9     test medical devices for safety?  Is that the hospital's

           10     job?

           11     A.  Hospital, the word safety is key.  Hospital do tests for

           12     safety, if it's electrical safety.

           13     Q.  Okay.  If you're going to get shocked?

           14     A.  This is a phenomena that actually built my profession,

           15     but not justifiably, because I forgot his name.  In Women's

           16     magazine, published an article that in the late '60s, early

           17     70's, that 10,000 patients in U.S. hospital are getting

           18     electrocuted every year from electric beds in hospitals and

           19     that the electro safety is not being governed, so the early

           20     biomedical engineers' job was to make sure that the

           21     electrical beds are safe in hospitals.

           22     Q.  In terms of a true risk benefit analysis, is that

           23     something the hospital does on medical devices or the

           24     manufacturers?  Or I guess other folks would be the better

           25     way to say it?


 

                                                                             1026



            1     A.  Honestly, it's a case-by-case analysis, so you make the

            2     determination which one is more effective, and when you say

            3     risk benefit ratio, sometimes you hire a manufacturer to do

            4     it, sometime an independent service organization to do the

            5     maintenance.  Sometimes you do it yourself.  In my program

            6     over the 25 years, we use combination of all the three

            7     depends what was the most effective.

            8     Q.  Did you have experience with any type of patient warming

            9     systems in your 25 years at the medical center?

           10     A.  Even though we lived in Houston, yes, I had a lot of

           11     experience with warming devices.

           12     Q.  What type of warming devices did you work with, work on

           13     at the medical center?

           14     A.  Various ones.  First of all, I would preface that by

           15     saying that the major part of my job was the pediatric

           16     hospital known as Texas Children's Hospital, neonatal, the

           17     small baby, the premature baby, the small children, there

           18     have much more difficult time to control the temperature of

           19     the body than you and me.  So the adult patient is more able

           20     to stay within the physiological parameter of normal

           21     temperature, but babies cannot.

           22               So to begin with, most of the warming, early

           23     warming work that I did on devices were for keeping baby

           24     warm and comfortable immediately post delivery.  So those

           25     would be incubators.  Those would be something called infant


 

                                                                             1027



            1     warmers that have different principle, different technology,

            2     how to achieve it.

            3               We also designed in the entrance of the emergency

            4     room a ceiling with radiated heat, so when we have a trauma

            5     coming in, immediately the patient is going to be exposed to

            6     a warm environment, that would help to treat the patient.

            7     So we designed that.  We experiment with variety of

            8     techniques.

            9               And then we were doing 50,000 operating rooms a

           10     year.  That's a phenomena in the world.  So for

           11     cardiovascular patient, this is a long procedure, and you

           12     want to keep the patient warm, variety of water circulating

           13     devices, convection, conduction, radiation, all of that I

           14     used.

           15     Q.  You're familiar with how to warm a patient?

           16     A.  Oh, yes.

           17     Q.  Let me ask you this.  After you left Texas Children's,

           18     what year did you leave or I guess the Texas Medical Center?

           19     A.  Ten years.

           20     Q.  Okay, so 2008?

           21     A.  Correct.

           22     Q.  What have you been doing since?

           23     A.  I have been consultant in the business, and I have my

           24     own company, Biomedical Engineering Consultants, LLC.

           25     Q.  Do you work with hospitals?


 

                                                                             1028



            1     A.  Yes.

            2     Q.  What type of work do you do with hospitals?

            3     A.  I provide the operational improvement, audit for

            4     hospital as it relates to technology.  How you identify a

            5     specific technology that meet your clinical needs when you

            6     expand on the new programs or build a hospital.

            7               I just finished a project, a long term project

            8     with Stanford Medical School as they build new facility, new

            9     hospitals for the adults patient and for the pediatric

           10     patient, two new hospital.  They wanted to understand how

           11     they can be better equipped to deal with the future

           12     technology, not the history that they were doing with, and

           13     they asked me to come and do an audit and propose a

           14     solution.

           15     Q.  Do you work with medical device manufacturers?

           16     A.  I also work with medical device manufacturers, correct.

           17     Q.  Do you help them get their product from concept to out

           18     in the marketplace?

           19     A.  With medical device manufacturer, I help in the move

           20     from concept to manufacturing and then in the after-market

           21     sale in support of medical devices.

           22     Q.  Have you done work with the World Health Organization?

           23     A.  I hope you find from my voice that I'm very passionate

           24     about my field, and I'm technical advisor to the World

           25     Health Organization where I volunteer to travel the world


 

                                                                             1029



            1     and go to countries with low resource, basically poor

            2     countries in Central America, South America, Africa, Asia,

            3     and I've been in Mongolia hospital six months ago teaching

            4     and giving workshop how to manage the medical technology

            5     better.

            6     Q.  Have you done something called forensic engineering?

            7     A.  Yes.  That's the other part of my professional career

            8     and that's forensic engineering.

            9     Q.  What is forensic engineering?

           10     A.  Forensic engineering is basically come from the word

           11     forensic, which is in the public debate, what is not exactly

           12     understood how and why it's happening.  Medical, medical

           13     pathologists perform forensic work from the medical point of

           14     view to understand how a death occurs.  I'm doing it for

           15     medical devices.

           16               So forensic engineer is individual in the

           17     biomedical engineering field like myself who is looking at

           18     unintended outcome, adverse event, when something not good

           19     happen to a patient to perform the investigation, to keep us

           20     question how, why, until you find the root cause analysis,

           21     so you can meet again, you can prevent that from happening

           22     again.  So, I actually do a lot of that work.

           23     Q.  How many forensic investigation cases have you looked at

           24     in your career?

           25     A.  I'm looking at between three and four hundred cases that


 

                                                                             1030



            1     I've investigated.

            2     Q.  Do you have an example of one you've done?  If you can

            3     find one?

            4     A.  We should go and have a drink because those stories are

            5     unbelievable sometime.  Something interesting is a case of a

            6     judge in Alabama that was going to catheterization because

            7     he has a block in the artery in the vessel that bring oxygen

            8     to the heart muscle, and he was going to have a stint put

            9     in.  A stint is a small mesh that you put in the small

           10     vessels, and you let it go and open up and instead of

           11     suction, now you have a good flow of oxygen to the muscle

           12     and the heart work fine.

           13               This cardiologist have done hundreds of patients

           14     like this before.  He used this product a hundred times

           15     before, and he used the same way, the same series of steps.

           16     Unfortunately, with this judge, he blew up the vessel.  He

           17     put the stint, the stint just expand and blew up.  Nobody

           18     could understand why, and nobody could understand how can we

           19     prevent that from happening again?

           20               The hospital called me up and said, "would you

           21     come and do your forensic stuff," quote unquote?  And I

           22     worked on that for a long time, interviewed the

           23     cardiologist, measured the pressure he put on the stint,

           24     looked at the product, the product literature, talked to the

           25     manufacturers and could not figure out what happened until


 

                                                                             1031



            1     one evening I was sitting with the packaging of the stint in

            2     front of me and realized that this small ring in the center

            3     of the stint, it's called radio pick ring.  This is the ring

            4     that you can see in x-ray when they put it in the heart,

            5     they look at the x-ray, cardiologist can see if it's exactly

            6     where the constraint is, so they know it's in the right

            7     place.

            8               The ring was placed instead of in the middle of

            9     the stint at the end.  It was a manufacturing change, but it

           10     was not communicated.  And when the cardiologist put the

           11     stint --

           12               MS. PRUITT:  Your Honor, I apologize.  I don't

           13     understand the relevance of this.  We object under 402.

           14               MR. FARRAR:  Just going to his background, his

           15     credentials and his qualifications.

           16               THE COURT:  Yeah, let's --

           17               MR. FARRAR:  All right.

           18     BY MR. FARRAR:

           19     Q.  I'll ask you one more question on the issue.  Have you

           20     received any awards for your work, Dr. David?

           21     A.  I'm fortunate to receive several recommendations from

           22     different organizations, different parts of my career, and I

           23     have just been informed that I've been inducted to the Hall

           24     of Fame of the American College of Clinical Engineering

           25     Society of 25 years old, and I'm going to be the seventh


 

                                                                             1032



            1     person to receive that recommendation.  I received other

            2     awards including a special award from the FDA Commissioner

            3     for protecting public safety.

            4     Q.  I want to ask you about the work you've done in this

            5     case and ask if you've done a device hazard analysis on the

            6     Bair Hugger?

            7     A.  I did.

            8     Q.  What is a device hazard analysis?

            9     A.  So, hazard is looking at the probability of risk

           10     existing to the severity and the frequency that is not

           11     acceptable to this type of patient.  In other words, when

           12     you're going to use the product on patient with specific

           13     condition, is the probability and severity of something

           14     unintended happen is high or low.  And are there methods to

           15     identify those probability and severity, and if they are,

           16     can you do redesign or apply other controls to reduce it to

           17     acceptable level.

           18     Q.  When you're doing that, what's your methodology?  What

           19     information do you want?  How do you go about doing that?

           20     A.  I developed the methodology during my work at the Texas

           21     Medical Center, as I mentioned before, and it has been used

           22     since very successfully.  What you are looking for is to

           23     have information from the source that knows it all,

           24     basically the manufacturer.  He, I'll call it he or she, but

           25     this is the entity that design, manufacture and produced the


 

                                                                             1033



            1     product.  They have most of the information about the hazard

            2     associated with the device.

            3               You are looking at the least of those hazards and

            4     categorize them in the way from most severe to least severe

            5     and look at those at the highest level and see what are the

            6     probability or possibility to eliminate or mitigate those.

            7     Q.  What was the hazard or the injury danger that you were

            8     looking at specific with the Bair Hugger?

            9     A.  With the Bair Hugger was the issue of increased

           10     infection during surgical procedure.

           11     Q.  Deep joint infections?

           12     A.  Correct.

           13     Q.  Now, one of the things you want to understand the

           14     device, is that fair?

           15     A.  That would be very fair.

           16     Q.  What is it specifically about the device that you're

           17     looking at?

           18     A.  I'm looking at the design, looking at the principal of

           19     operation, and looking at the intended use, and how it is

           20     becoming in contact with the patient and the environment

           21     that it's used.  So those are the three things:  It's

           22     function, application or use and then environment.

           23     Q.  The function is what it's supposed to do, what it's

           24     intended benefit is?

           25     A.  Correct.


 

                                                                             1034



            1     Q.  What is the function as you understood of the Bair

            2     Hugger?

            3     A.  The Bair Hugger function as stated in the manual is to

            4     warm patient and in the perioperative time.

            5     Q.  You said "perioperative."  Did you look at the function

            6     of models preceding the 505 to see what their function was?

            7               MS. PRUITT:  Objection, Your Honor, relevance.

            8               THE COURT:  Sustained.

            9               THE WITNESS:  Yes, perioperative, by the way, is a

           10     word that's described around surgery before, after, not just

           11     surgery.

           12     BY MR. FARRAR:

           13     Q.  It's around before, during and after?

           14     A.  Correct.

           15     Q.  Specifically, for the Bair Hugger 505, you were looking

           16     at intraoperatively, which would be a little more precise

           17     term?

           18     A.  Correct.

           19     Q.  The operation of the Bair Hugger, did you look and do

           20     research into basically how it works?

           21     A.  Absolutely.  I took it apart even.

           22     Q.  Can you explain how the Bair Hugger, how they work?

           23     A.  Sure.  The Bair Hugger has a grille in the base where

           24     air is being sucked in by a fan that is circulating inside

           25     its box.  The air that is being sucked in through the Bair


 

                                                                             1035



            1     Hugger enclosure --

            2               MS. PRUITT:  Your Honor, objection.  This is in

            3     violation of MIL2 that the Court has already ruled on.

            4               THE COURT:  You're asking in very general terms,

            5     so you can go ahead and finish.

            6               THE WITNESS:  The air that is being sucked in is

            7     passing through a heating element and being pushed to a

            8     blanket that is in touch with the patient through a hose and

            9     the perforation in the blanket of the patient, release the

           10     air that is being warmed and pushed from the Bair Hugger

           11     enclosure to the patient.

           12     BY MR. FARRAR:

           13     Q.  And do you have an understanding on the blanket if it's

           14     sitting on top of the blanket, so the air is coming out and

           15     down?

           16     A.  That would be the physical corrective description.

           17     Q.  The environment of use.  What is your understanding of

           18     the environment of use of the Bair Hugger?

           19     A.  My understanding that the Bair Hugger device intend to

           20     warm patients in a hospital including surgical procedure.

           21     Q.  Well, specifically, did you focus on a more narrow

           22     environment of use than surgery in your device hazard

           23     analysis?

           24     A.  I specifically focussed on the use of Bair Hugger forced

           25     air device utilization in deep joint orthopedic surgery.


 

                                                                             1036



            1     Q.  Is that a, in your experience, a unique environment of

            2     use compared to just other surgeries?

            3     A.  Definitely unique environment.

            4     Q.  Why is that?

            5     A.  Because this environment is intended to protect the very

            6     susceptible patient to infection because of the procedure

            7     they go through, and they are, in that environment, there is

            8     several conditions that can accommodate to assure that the

            9     environment is more clean than other operating room.

           10     Q.  In your professional work for 25 years at the Medical

           11     Center and the I guess ten years since, do you typically

           12     rely on other experts in other fields to help you with your

           13     analysis?

           14     A.  Of course.  The medical device field is such a wide area

           15     that have many issues that have expertise opinion would help

           16     you to understand better the phenomenon.

           17     Q.  And during your analysis in this case, you told the

           18     ladies and gentlemen of the jury that you reviewed some

           19     company documents that you understood the function operation
